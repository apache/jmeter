<section name="&sect-num;. Building an FTP Test Plan" anchor="building">
<p>In this section, you will learn how to create a basic
<a href="build-test-plan.html">Test Plan</a> to test an FTP site.  You will
create four users that send requests for two files on the O'Reilly FTP site.
Also, you will tell the users to run their tests twice. So, the total number of
requests is (4 users) x (2 requests) x (repeat 2 times) = 16 FTP requests. To
construct the Test Plan, you will use the following elements:
<a href="test_plan.html#thread_group">Thread Group</a>,
<complink name="FTP Request"/>,
<complink name="FTP Request Defaults"/>, and
<complink name="Spline Visualizer"/>.</p>

<note>This example uses the O'Reilly FTP site, www.oro.com. Please be considerate
when running this example, and (if possible) consider running against another
FTP site.</note>

</section>

<section name="&sect-num;.1 Adding Users" anchor="adding_users">
<p>The first step you want to do with every JMeter Test Plan is to add a
<a href="test_plan.html#thread_group">Thread Group</a> element.  The Thread Group tells
JMeter the number of users you want to simulate, how often the users should send
requests, and the how many requests they should send.</p>

<p>Go ahead and add the ThreadGroup element by first selecting the Test Plan,
clicking your right mouse button to get the Add menu, and then select
Add --&gt; ThreadGroup.</p>

<p>You should now see the Thread Group element under Test Plan.  If you do not
see the element, then "expand" the Test Plan tree by clicking on the
Test Plan element.</p>

<p>Next, you need to modify the default properties.  Select the Thread Group element
in the tree, if you have not already selected it. You should now see the Thread
Group Control Panel in the right section of the JMeter window (see Figure &sect-num;.1
below)</p>

<figure image="webtest/threadgroup.png">
Figure &sect-num;.1. Thread Group with Default Values</figure>

<p>Start by providing a more descriptive name for our Thread Group. In the name
field, enter O'Reilly Users.</p>

<p>Next, increase the number of users to 4.</p>

<p>In the next field, the Ramp-Up Period, leave the the default value of 0
seconds.  This property tells JMeter how long to delay between starting each
user. For example, if you enter a Ramp-Up Period of 5 seconds, JMeter will
finish starting all of your users by the end of the 5 seconds.  So, if we have
5 users and a 5 second Ramp-Up Period, then the delay between starting users
would be 1 second (5 users / 5 seconds = 1 user per second).  If you set the
value to 0, then JMeter will immediately start all of your users.</p>

<p>Finally, enter a value of 2 in
the Loop Count field.  This property tells JMeter how many times to repeat your
test. To have JMeter repeatedly run your Test Plan, select the Forever
checkbox.</p>

<note>In most applications, you have to manually accept
changes you make in a Control Panel.  However, in JMeter, the Control Panel
automatically accepts your changes as you make them.  If you change the
name of an element, the tree will be updated with the new text after you
leave the Control Panel (for example, when selecting another tree element).</note>

<p>See Figure &sect-num;.2 for the completed O'Reilly Users Thread Group.</p>

<section name="&sect-num;.2 Adding Default FTP Request Properties" anchor="adding_defaults">
<p>Now that we have defined our users, it is time define the tasks that they
will be performing.  In this section, you will specify the default settings
for your FTP requests.  And then, in section &sect-num;.3, you will add FTP Request
elements which use some of the default settings you specified here.</p>

<p>Begin by selecting the O'Reilly Users element. Click your right mouse button
to get the Add menu, and then select Add --&gt; Config Element --&gt; FTP Request
Defaults. Then, select this new element to view its Control Panel (see Figure &sect-num;.3).
</p>

<figure image="ftptest/ftp-defaults.png">
Figure &sect-num;.3. FTP Request Defaults</figure>

<p>
Like most JMeter elements, the <complink name="FTP Request Defaults"/> Control
Panel has a name field that you can modify.  In this example, leave this field with
the default value.</p>

<p>Skip to the next field, which is the FTP Server's Server Name/IP. For the
Test Plan that you are building, all FTP requests will be sent to the same
FTP server, ftp.oro.com.  Enter this domain name into the field.
This is the only field that we will specify a default, so leave the remaining
fields with their default values.</p>

<note>The FTP Request Defaults element does not tell JMeter
to send an FTP request.  It simply defines the default values that the
FTP Request elements use.</note>

<p>See Figure &sect-num;.4 for the completed FTP Request Defaults element</p>

<section name="&sect-num;.3 Adding FTP Requests" anchor="adding_requests">

<p>In our Test Plan, we need to make two FTP requests. The first one is for the
O'Reilly mSQL Java README file (ftp://ftp.oro.com/pub/msql/java/README), and the
second is for the tutorial file (ftp://ftp.oro.com/pub/msql/java/tutorial.txt).</p>

<note>JMeter sends requests in the order that they appear in the tree.</note>

<p>Start by adding the first <complink name="FTP Request"/>
to the O'Reilly Users element (Add --&gt; Sampler --&gt; FTP Request).
Then, select the FTP Request element in the tree and edit the following properties
(see Figure &sect-num;.5):
<ol>
<li>Change the Name to "README".</li>
<li>Change the File to Retrieve From Server field to "pub/msql/java/README".</li>
<li>Change the Username field to "anonymous".</li>
<li>Change the Password field to "anonymous".</li>
</ol>
</p>

<note>You do not have to set the Server Name field because you already specified
this value in the FTP Request Defaults element.</note>

<figure image="ftptest/ftp-request.png">

<p>Next, add the second FTP Request and edit the following properties (see
Figure &sect-num;.6:
<ol>
<li>Change the Name to "tutorial".</li>
<li>Change the File to Retrieve From Server field to "pub/msql/java/tutorial.txt".</li>
<li>Change the Username field to "anonymous".</li>
<li>Change the Password field to "anonymous".</li>
</ol>

<section name="&sect-num;.4 Adding a Listener to View/Store the Test Results" anchor="adding_listener">
<p>The final element you need to add to your Test Plan is a
 <a href="component_reference.html#listeners">Listener</a>. This element is
responsible for storing all of the results of your FTP requests in a file and presenting
a visual model of the data.</p>

<p>Select the O'Reilly Users element and add a <complink name="Spline Visualizer"/>
listener (Add --&gt; Listener --&gt; Spline Visualizer).</p>
