We also thank bug reporters who helped us improve JMeter. <br/>
For this release we want to give special thanks to the following reporters for the clear reports and tests made after our fixes:

Apologies if we have omitted anyone else.

 <!--  =================== Known bugs =================== -->
 
<ch_section>Known bugs</ch_section>

<ul>
<li>The Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</li>

<li>
The numbers that appear to the left of the green box are the number of active threads / total number of threads, 
the total number of threads only applies to a locally run test, otherwise it will show 0 (see <bugzilla>55510</bugzilla>).
</li>

<li>
Note that there is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6396599 ">bug in Java</a>
on some Linux systems that manifests itself as the following error when running the test cases or JMeter itself:
<pre>
 [java] WARNING: Couldn't flush user prefs:
 java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException:
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Not supported: indent-number
</pre>
This does not affect JMeter operation. This issue is fixed since Java 7b05.
</li>

<li>
Note that under some windows systems you may have this WARNING:
<pre>
java.util.prefs.WindowsPreferences 
WARNING: Could not open/create prefs root node Software\JavaSoft\Prefs at root 0
x80000002. Windows RegCreateKeyEx(...) returned error code 5.
</pre>
The fix is to run JMeter as Administrator, it will create the registry key for you, then you can restart JMeter as a normal user and you won't have the warning anymore.
</li>

<li>
With Oracle Java 7 and Mac Book Pro Retina Display, the JMeter GUI may look blurry. 
This is a known Java bug, see Bug <a href="http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8000629" >JDK-8000629</a>.
A workaround is to use a Java 7 update 40 runtime which fixes this issue.
</li>

<li>
You may encounter the following error: <i>java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints</i>
 if you run a HTTPS request on a web site with a SSL certificate (itself or one of SSL certificates in its chain of trust) with a signature
 algorithm using MD2 (like md2WithRSAEncryption) or with a SSL certificate with a size lower than 1024 bits.
This error is related to increased security in Java 7 version u16 (MD2) and version u40 (Certificate size lower than 1024 bits), and Java 8 too.
<br></br>
To allow you to perform your HTTPS request, you can downgrade the security of your Java installation by editing 
the Java <b>jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms</b> property. Remove the MD2 value or the constraint on size, depending on your case.
<br></br>
This property is in this file:
<pre>JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</pre>
See  <bugzilla>56357</bugzilla> for details.
</li>

<li>
Under Mac OSX Aggregate Graph will show wrong values due to mirroring effect on numbers.
This is due to a known Java bug, see Bug <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8065373" >JDK-8065373</a> 
The fix is to use JDK7_u79, JDK8_u45 or later.
</li>

<li>
View Results Tree may fail to display some HTML code under HTML renderer, see <bugzilla>54586</bugzilla>.
This is due to a known Java bug which fails to parse "px" units in row/col attributes.
See Bug <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8031109" >JDK-8031109</a> 
The fix is to use JDK9 b65 or later.
</li>
