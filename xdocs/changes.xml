<note>
JMeter 6.x requires Java 17 or later for execution (Java 21 is recommended).

 <!--  =================== Known bugs or issues related to JAVA Bugs =================== -->

<ch_section>Known problems and workarounds</ch_section>
<ul>
<li>The Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</li>

<li>
The numbers that appear to the left of the green box are the number of active threads / total number of threads,
the total number of threads only applies to a locally run test, otherwise it will show <code>0</code> (see <bugzilla>55510</bugzilla>).
</li>

<li>
Note that under some windows systems you may have this WARNING:
<source>
java.util.prefs.WindowsPreferences
WARNING: Could not open/create prefs root node Software\JavaSoft\Prefs at root 0
x80000002. Windows RegCreateKeyEx(&hellip;) returned error code 5.
</source>
The fix is to run JMeter as Administrator, it will create the registry key for you, then you can restart JMeter as a normal user and you won't have the warning anymore.
</li>

<li>
You may encounter the following error:
<source>java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints</source>
 if you run a HTTPS request on a web site with a SSL certificate (itself or one of SSL certificates in its chain of trust) with a signature
 algorithm using MD2 (like <code>md2WithRSAEncryption</code>) or with a SSL certificate with a size lower than 1024 bits.
This error is related to increased security in Java 8+.
<br></br>
To allow you to perform your HTTPS request, you can downgrade the security of your Java installation by editing
the Java <code>jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms</code> property. Remove the MD2 value or the constraint on size, depending on your case.
<br></br>
This property is in this file:
<source>JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</source>
See  <bugzilla>56357</bugzilla> for details.
</li>

<li>
Since Java 11 the JavaScript implementation <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/335">Nashorn has been deprecated</a>.
Java will emit the following deprecation warnings, if you are using JavaScript based on Nashorn.
<source>
Warning: Nashorn engine is planned to be removed from a future JDK release
</source>
To silence these warnings, add <code>-Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning</code> to your Java arguments.
That can be achieved by setting the enviroment variable <code>JVM_ARGS</code>
<source>
export JVM_ARGS="-Dnashorn.args=--no-deprecation-warning"
</source>
</li>

<li>
With Java 15 the JavaScript implementation <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/372">Nashorn has been removed</a>. To add back a JSR-223 compatible JavaScript engine you have two options:
  <dl>
    <dt>Use Mozilla Rhino</dt>
    <dd>Copy <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/releases/download/Rhino1_7_14_Release/rhino-engine-1.7.14.jar">rhino-engine-1.7.14.jar</a> into <code>$JMETER_HOME/lib/ext</code>.</dd>
    <dt>Use OpenJDK Nashorn</dt>
    <dd>
      The OpenJDK Nashorn implementation comes as a module. To use it, you will have to download it and add it to the module path. A hacky way to download the version 15.0 (or later) and its dependencies and set the module path is outlined below:
      <source>
mkdir lib/modules
pushd lib/modules
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/openjdk/nashorn/nashorn-core/15.4/nashorn-core-15.4.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm/9.6/asm-9.6.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-commons/9.6/asm-commons-9.6.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-util/9.6/asm-util-9.6.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-tree/9.6/asm-tree-9.6.jar
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-analysis/9.6/asm-analysis-9.6.jar
popd
export JVM_ARGS="--module-path $PWD/lib/modules"
./bin/jmeter
      </source>
    </dd>
  </dl>
</li>

</ul>
