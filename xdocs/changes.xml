<!--  ========================= End of summary ===================================== -->

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
[The behaviour has improved, but language change is still not fully working]
To override the default local language fully, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>
