	<h2>Where are the nightly builds?</h2>
	<p>There are currently no regular nightly builds - sorry.</p>
    <p>However, occasional builds are made available via the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_jmeter.cgi">Binary Downloads</a> 
page - follow <b>Nightly builds</b> link.
</p>
	<h2>What do they consist of?</h2>
<p>
JMeter is distributed as a set of zip (or tar-gz) archive files.

The files are called:
<ul>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_bin.zip - JMeter binaries</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_lib.zip - 3rd party jar files</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_src.zip - JMeter source</li>
<li>jakarta-jmeter-{version}_api.zip - JMeter Javadoc</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing JMeter runtime</h2>
Download the _bin and _lib files
<br/>
Unpack the archives into the same directory structure
<br/>

The other archives are not needed to run JMeter.
</p>
<h2>Warning - please note!</h2>
<p>
	The nightly builds may or may not work properly - or at all.<br/>
	If there is a problem with a particular version, 
    it may be worth reporting this on the JMeter-dev mailing list and/or trying again in a day or two.
