        <note>
            Make sure the required jar files are in JMeter's lib directory. If they are not, shutdown JMeter,
            copy the jar files over and restart JMeter. 
            See <a href="get-started.html#libraries_activemq">Getting Started</a> for details.
        </note>

            <p>In this section, you will learn how to create a
                <a href="build-test-plan.html">Test Plan</a> to test a JMS Point-to-Point messaging solution.
The setup of the test is 1 threadgroup with 5 threads sending 4 messages each through a request queue.
A fixed reply queue will be used for monitoring the reply messages.
To construct the Test Plan, you will use the
following elements:
                <a href="test_plan.html#thread_group">Thread Group</a>,
                <complink name="JMS Point-to-Point"/>, and
                <complink name="Graph Results"/>.
            </p>

            <p>General notes on JMS: There are currently two JMS samplers. One uses JMS topics
and the other uses queues. Topic messages are commonly known as pub/sub messaging.
Topic messaging is generally used in cases where a message is published by a producer and
consumed by multiple subscribers.  A JMS sampler needs the JMS implementation jar files;
for example, from Apache ActiveMQ.  See <a href="#libraries_activemq">here</a> for the list
of jars provided by ActiveMQ 3.0.</p>

        <section name="&sect-num;.1 Adding a Thread Group" anchor="adding_threadgroup">
            <p>The first step you want to do with every JMeter Test Plan is to add a
                <a href="test_plan.html#thread_group">Thread Group</a> element.  The Thread Group tells
JMeter the number of users you want to simulate, how often the users should send
requests, and the how many requests they should send.
            </p>

            <p>Go ahead and add the ThreadGroup element by first selecting the Test Plan,
clicking your right mouse button to get the Add menu, and then select
Add --&gt; ThreadGroup.</p>

            <p>You should now see the Thread Group element under Test Plan.  If you do not
see the element, then "expand" the Test Plan tree by clicking on the
Test Plan element.</p>

            <p>Next, you need to modify the default properties.  Select the Thread Group element
in the tree, if you have not already selected it. You should now see the Thread
Group Control Panel in the right section of the JMeter window (see Figure &sect-num;.1
below)</p>

            <figure image="webtest/threadgroup.png">
Figure &sect-num;.1. Thread Group with Default Values</figure>

            <p>Start by providing a more descriptive name for our Thread Group. In the name
field, enter Point-to-Point.</p>

            <p>Next, increase the number of users (called threads) to 5.</p>

            <p>In the next field, the Ramp-Up Period, leave set the value to 0
seconds.  This property tells JMeter how long to delay between starting each
user. For example, if you enter a Ramp-Up Period of 5 seconds, JMeter will
finish starting all of your users by the end of the 5 seconds.  So, if we have
5 users and a 5 second Ramp-Up Period, then the delay between starting users
would be 1 second (5 users / 5 seconds = 1 user per second).  If you set the
value to 0, then JMeter will immediately start all of your users.</p>

            <p>Clear the checkbox labeled "Forever", and enter a value of 4 in the Loop
Count field.  This property tells JMeter how many times to repeat your test.
If you enter a loop count value of 0, then JMeter will run your test only
once. To have JMeter repeatedly run your Test Plan, select the Forever
checkbox.</p>

            <note>In most applications, you have to manually accept
changes you make in a Control Panel.  However, in JMeter, the Control Panel
automatically accepts your changes as you make them.  If you change the
name of an element, the tree will be updated with the new text after you
leave the Control Panel (for example, when selecting another tree element).</note>

        <section name="&sect-num;.2 Adding JMS Point-to-Point Sampler" anchor="adding_point_to_point_sampler">

            <p>Start by adding the sampler <complink name="JMS Point-to-Point"/>
to the Point-to-Point element (Add --&gt; Sampler --&gt; JMS Point-to-Point).
Then, select the JMS Point-to-Point sampler element in the tree.
 In building the example a configuration will be provided that works with ActiveMQ 3.0.

        <section name="&sect-num;.3 Adding a Listener to View Store the Test Results" anchor="adding_listener">
            <p>The final element you need to add to your Test Plan is a
                <a href="component_reference.html#listeners">Listener</a>. This element is
responsible for storing all of the results of your JMS requests in a file and presenting
a visual model of the data.
            </p>

            <p>Select the Thread Group element and add a
                <complink name="Graph Results"/> listener (Add --&gt; Listener
--&gt; Graph Results).  Next, you need to specify a directory and filename of the
output file.  You can either type it into the filename field, or select the
Browse button and browse to a directory and then enter a filename.
