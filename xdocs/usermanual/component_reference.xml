<component name="HTTP Request" index="15.1.2" screenshot="gen-controller/http-request.png">

<description>
        <p>This sampler lets you send an HTTP/HTTPS request to a web server.  It
        also lets you control whether or not JMeter parses HTML files for images and
        Java applets and sends HTTP requests to retrieve them.</p>
        <p>If you are going to send multiple requests to the same web server, consider
        using an <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/>
        Configuration Element so you do not have to enter the same information for each
        HTTP Request.</p>

        <p>Or, instead of manually adding HTTP Requests, you may want to use
        JMeter's <complink name="HTTP Proxy Server"/> to create
        them.  This can save you time if you have a lot of HTTP requests or requests with many
        parameters.</p>

        <p>If the request requires a login authorization, you will also have to add an
        <complink name="HTTP Authorization Manager"/>
        Configuration Element. And, if the request uses cookies, then you will also need an
        <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/>.  You can
        add either of these elements to the Thread Group or the HTTP Request.  If you have
        more than one HTTP Request that needs authorizations or cookies, then add the
        elements to the Thread Group.  That way, all HTTP Request controllers will share the
        same Authorization Manager and Cookie Manager elements.</p>

        <p>If the request uses a technique called "URL Rewriting" to maintain sessions,
        then see section
        <a href="build-adv-web-test-plan.html#session_url_rewriting">6.1 Handling User Sessions With URL Rewriting</a>

        <property name="Path" required="Yes">The path to resource (for example, /servlets/myServlet). If the
resource requires query string parameters, add them below in the
"Send Parameters With the Request" section.</property>
        <property name="Send Parameters With the Request" required="No">The query string will
        be generated from the list of parameters you provide.  Each parameter has a <i>name</i> and
        <i>value</i>, the options to encode the parameter, and an option to include or exclude an equals sign (some applications
        don't expect an equals when the value is the empty string).  The query string will be generated in the correct fashion, depending on
        the choice of "Method" you made (ie if you chose GET, the query string will be
        appended to the URL, if POST, then it will be sent separately).  Also, if you are
        sending a file using a multipart form, the query string will be created using the
        multipart form specifications.
        <p>
        Additionally, you can specify whether each paramter should be URL encoded.  If you are not sure what this
        means, it is probably best to select it.  If your values contain characters such as &amp;amp; or spaces, or
        question marks, then encoding is usually required.</p></property>

  <p>There are two ways to create test cases for testing a LDAP Server.</p>
  <ol><li>Inbuilt Test cases.</li>
    <li>User defined Test cases.</li></ol>

    <p>There are four test scenarios of testing LDAP. The tests are given below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add Test</li>
      <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
        <p>This will add a pre-defined entry in the LDAP Server and calculate
          the execution time. After execution of the test, the created entry will be
          deleted from the LDAP
          Server.</p></li>
          <li>User defined test :
            <p>This will add the entry in the LDAP Server. User has to enter all the
              attributes in the table.The entries are collected from the table to add. The
              execution time is calculated. The created entry will not be deleted after the
              test.</p></li></ol>

              <li>Modify Test</li>
              <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
                <p>This will create a pre-defined entry first, then will modify the
                  created	entry in the LDAP Server.And calculate the execution time. After
                  execution
                  of the test, the created entry will be deleted from the LDAP Server.</p></li>
                  <li>User defined test
                    <p>This will modify the entry in the LDAP Server. User has to enter all the
                      attributes in the table. The entries are collected from the table to modify.
                      The execution time is calculated. The entry will not be deleted from the LDAP
                      Server.</p></li></ol>

                      <li>Search Test</li>
                      <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
                        <p>This will create the entry first, then will search if the attributes
                          are available. It calculates the execution time of the search query. At the
                          end of  the execution,created entry will be deleted from the LDAP Server.</p></li>
                          <li>User defined test
                            <p>This will search the user defined entry(Search filter) in the Search
                              base (again, defined by the user). The entries should be available in the LDAP
                              Server. The execution time is  calculated.</p></li></ol>

                              <li>Delete Test</li>
                              <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
                                <p>This will create a pre-defined entry first, then it will be deleted
                                  from the LDAP Server. The execution time is calculated.</p></li>

                                  <li>User defined test
                                    <p>This will delete the user-defined entry in the LDAP Server. The entries

<component name="WebService(SOAP) Request (Beta Code)" index="15.1.7" screenshot="webservice_sampler.png">

<description><p>This sampler has been tested with IIS Webservice running .NET 1.0. It
 hasn't been tested with SUN or IBM webservices providers, but it should work.
 The sampler uses Apache SOAP driver to serialize the message and set the header
 with the correct SOAPAction. Right now the sampler doesn't support automatic WSDL
 handling, since Apache SOAP currently does not provide support for it. Both IBM
 and SUN provide WSDL drivers. There are 3 options for the post data: text area,
 external file, or directory. If you want the sampler to randomly select a message,
 use the directory. Otherwise, use the text area or a file. The if either the
 file or path are set, it will not use the message in the text area. If you need
 to test a soap service that uses different encoding, use the file or path. If you
 paste the message in to text area, it will not retain the encoding and will result
 in errors. Save your message to a file with the proper encoding, and the sampler
 will read it as java.io.FileInputStream.</p>
 <p>The sampler requires mail.jar and activation.jar. This is because Apache SOAP
 requires the libs. Because mail.jar and activation.jar are distributed by Sun,
 you have to download it separately.</p>
 <p>An important note on the sampler is it will automatically use the proxy host
 and port passed to JMeter from command line, if thoe fields in the sampler are
 left blank. If a sampler has values in the proxy host and port text field, it
 will use the ones provided by the user. This behavior may not be what users
 expect.</p>
 <p>By default, the webservice sampler set SOAPHTTPConnection.setMaintainSession
 (true). If you need to maintain the session, add a blank Header Manager. The
 sampler uses the Header Manager to store the SOAPHTTPConnection object, since
 there apache soap does provide a easy way to get and set the cookies.</p>

<component name="Tomcat Access Log Sampler" index="15.1.8" screenshot="">
<center><h2>(Alpha Code)</h2></center>
<description><p>AccessLogSampler was designed to read access logs and generate http requests.
For those not familiar with the access log, it is the log the webserver maintains of every
request it accepted. This means the every image and html file. The current implementation
is complete, but some features have not been enabled. There is a filter for the access
log parser, but I haven't figured out how to link to the pre-processor. Once I do, changes
to the sampler will be made to enable that functionality.</p>
<p>Tomcat uses the common format for access logs. This means any webserver that uses the
common log format can use the AccessLogSampler. Server that use common log format include:
Tomcat, Resin, Weblogic, and SunOne. Common log format looks
like this:</p>
<p>127.0.0.1 - - [21/Oct/2003:05:37:21 -0500] "GET /index.jsp?%2Findex.jsp= HTTP/1.1" 200 8343</p>
<p>The current implemenation of the parser only looks at the text within the quotes.
Everything else is stripped out and igored. For example, the response code is completely
ignored by the parser. For the future, it might be nice to filter out entries that
do not have a response code of 200. Extending the sampler should be fairly simple. There
are two interfaces you have to implement.</p>
<p>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.LogParser</p>
<p>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.Generator</p>
<p>The current implementation of AccessLogSampler uses the generator to create a new
HTTPSampler. The servername, port and get images are set by AccessLogSampler. Next,
the parser is called with integer 1, telling it to parse one entry. After that,
HTTPSampler.sample() is called to make the request.
<code>
<pre>
            samp = (HTTPSampler) GENERATOR.generateRequest();
            samp.setDomain(this.getDomain());

The required methods in LogParser are: setGenerator(Generator) and parse(int).
Classes implementing Generator interface should provide concrete implementation
for all the methods. For an example of how to implement either interface, refer to

<p>
N.B. Each Sampler instance has its own BeanShell interpeter,
and Samplers are only called from a single thread
</p><p>
If the property "beanshell.sampler.init" is defined, it is passed to the Interpreter
as the name of a sourced file.
This can be used to define common methods and variables. 
There is a sample init file in the bin directory: BeanShellFunction.bshrc.
</p><p>
If a script file is supplied, that will be used, otherwise the script will be used.</p>
		<p>Before invoking the script, some variables are set up in the BeanShell interpreter:
			</p>
				<p>The contents of the Parameters field is put into the variable "Parameters".
			The string is also split into separate tokens using a single space as the separator, and the resulting list
			is stored in the String array bsh.args.</p>
			<p>The full list of variables that is set up is as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>log - the Logger</li>
		<li>Label - the Sampler label</li>
		<li>FileName - the file name, if any</li>
		<li>Parameters - text from the Parameters field</li>
		<li>bsh.args - the parameters, split as described above</li>
		<li>SampleResult - pointer to the current SampleResult</li>
			<li>ResponseCode = 200</li>
			<li>ResponseMessage = "OK"</li>
			<li>IsSuccess = true</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When the script completes, control is returned to the Sampler, and it copies the contents
			of the following script variables into the corresponding variables in the SampleResult:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>ResponseCode - for example 200</li>
			<li>ResponseMessage - for example "OK"</li>
			<li>IsSuccess - true/false</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Sampler ResponseData is set from the return value of the script.</p>
			<p>The SampleResult variable gives the script full access to all the fields and
				methods in the SampleResult. For example, the script has access to the methods
				setStopThread(boolean) and setStopTest(boolean).
				
				Here is a simple (not very useful!) example script:</p>
				
<pre>
if (bsh.args[0].equalsIgnoreCase("StopThread")) {
    log.info("Stop Thread detected!");
    SampleResult.StopThread(bsh.args[1]);
}
return "Data from sample with Label "+Label;

<description>
<p>The Once Only Logic Controller tells JMeter to process the controller(s) inside it only once, and pass over any requests under it
during further iterations through the test plan.</p>

<p>The Once Only Controller will now execute always during the first iteration of any looping parent controller.  Thus, if the Once Only Controller is placed under a Loop Controller specified to loop 5 times, then the Once Only Controller will execute only on the first iteration through the Loop Controller (ie, every 5 times).  Note this means the Once Only Controller will still behave as previously expected if put under a Thread Group (runs only once per test), but now the user has more flexibility in the use of the Once Only Controller.</p>

<p>For testing that requires a login, consider placing the login request in this controller since each thread only needs
to login once to establish a session.</p>

<p>The Throughput Controller allows the user to control how often it is executed.  There are two modes - percent execution and total executions.  Percent executions causes the controller to execute a certain percentage of the iterations through the test plan.  Total
executions causes the controller to stop executing after a certain number of executions have occurred.  Like the Once Only Controller, this
setting is reset when a parent Loop Controller restarts.

<component name="ForEach Controller" index="15.2.11" anchor="loop" screenshot="logic-controller/foreach-controller.png">
<description><p>A ForEach controller loops through the values of a set of related variables. 
When you add samplers (or controllers) to a ForEach controller, every sample sample (or controller)
is executed one or more times, where during every loop the variable has a new value.
The input should consist of several variables, each extended with an underscore and a number.
Each such variable must have a value.
So for example when the input variable has the name inputVar, the following variables should have been defined:
		<ul>
		<li>inputVar_1 = wendy</li>
		<li>inputVar_2 = charles</li>
		<li>inputVar_3 = peter</li>
		<li>inputVar_4 = john</li>
		</ul>
When the return variable is given as "returnVar", the collection of samplers and controllers under the ForEach controller will be executed 4 consecutive times,
with the return variable having the respective above values, which can then be used in the samplers.
</p>
<p>
It is especially suited for running with the regular expression post-processor. 
This can "create" the necessary input variables out of the result data of a previous request.
</p>
<note>The ForEach Controller does not run any samples if inputVar_1 is null.
This would be the case if the Regular Expression returned no matches.</note>

</p><p>The ForEach Controller extracts all variables with the prefix "inputVar_", and executes its

<section name="15.3 Listeners" anchor="listeners">
<description>
Most of the listeners perform several roles in addition to "listening"
to the test results.  They frequently also provide means to view,
save, and read saved test results.
<p>
The saving and reading of test results is generic.  The various
listeners generally have a panel whereby one can specify the file to
which the results will be written (or read).  By default,
the results are stored as CSV
files, typically with a ".jtl" extension.  Storing as CSV is the most efficient option, but is less detailed than XML (the other available option).</p>
<p>To change the format, in jmeter.properties, find the following line:</p>
<p>jmeter.save.saveservice.output_format=csv</p>
<p>Change "csv" to "xml" for greater detail.</p>
<p>
The information to be saved is configurable.  For maximum information, choose "xml" as the format and specify "Functional Test Mode" on the Test Plan element.  If this box is not checked, the default saved
data includes a time stamp (the number of milliseconds since midnight,
January 1, 1970 UTC), the data type, the thread name, the label, the
response time, message, and code, and a success indicator.  If checked, all information, including the full response data will be logged.</p>
<p>
One can get a more selective set of information my modifying the
jmeter.properties file.  The following example indicates how to set
properties to get a vertical bar ("|") delimited format that will
output results like:.</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
timeStamp|time|label|responseCode|threadName|dataType|success|failureMessage
02/06/03 08:21:42|1187|Backoffice Home|200|Thread Group-1|text|true|
02/06/03 08:21:42|47|Login BO|200|Thread Group-1|text|false|Test Failed, 
	expected to contain: password etc.
</pre>
</code></p>
<p>
The corresponding jmeter.properties file excerpt is below.  One oddity
in this example is that the output_format is set to csv, which
typically
indicates comma-separated values.  However, the default_delimiter was
set to be a vertical bar instead of a comma, so the csv tag is a
misnomer in this case.</p>

<p>The throughput number represents the actual number of requests/minute the server handled.  This calculation
includes any delays you added to your test and JMeter's own internal processing time.  The advantage
of doing the calculation like this is that this number represents something
real - your server in fact handled that many requests per minute, and you can increase the number of threads

that factored out delays and JMeter's processing, it would be unclear what you could conclude from that

<description>
<p>Monitor Results is a new Visualizer for displaying server
status. It is designed for Tomcat 5, but any servlet container
can port the status servlet and use this monitor. There are two primary
tabs for the monitor. The first is the "Health" tab, which will show the
status of one or more servers. The second tab labled "Performance" shows
the performance for one server for the last 1000 samples. The equations
used for the load calculation is included in the Visualizer.</p>
<p>Currently, the primary limitation of the monitor is system memory. A
quick benchmark of memory usage indicates a buffer of 1000 data points for
100 servers would take roughly 10Mb of RAM. On a 1.4Ghz centrino
laptop with 1Gb of ram, the monitor should be able to handle several
hundred servers.</p>
<p>As a general rule, monitoring production systems should take care to
set an appropriate interval. Intervals shorter than 5 seconds are too
aggressive and have a potential of impacting the server. With a buffer of
1000 data points at 5 second intervals, the monitor would check the server
status 12 times a minute or 720 times a hour. This means the buffer shows
the performance history of each machine for the last hour.</p>

<note>If there is more than one Authorization Manager in the scope of a Sampler,
there is currently no way to sepcify which one is to be used.</note>

<description>
<p>The Authorization Manager lets you specify one or more user logins for web pages that are
restricted using Basic HTTP Authentication.  You see this type of authentication when you use
your browser to access a restricted page, and your browser displays a login dialog box.  JMeter
transmits the login information when it encounters this type of page.</p>

<note>In the current release, all JMeter threads in a Thread Group use the same username/password
for a given Base URL even if you create multiple users with the same Base URL in the authorization table.
We plan to correct this in a future release.  As a workwaround, you can create multiple Thread Groups for your
Test Plan, with each Thread Group having its own Authorization Manager.
</note>

  <property name="Base URL" required="Yes">A partial or complete URL that matches one or more HTTP Request URLs.  As an example,
say you specify a Base URL of "http://jakarta.apache.org/restricted/" with a username of "jmeter" and
a password of "jmeter".  If you send an HTTP request to the URL
"http://jakarta.apache.org/restricted/ant/myPage.html", the Authorization Manager sends the login
information for the user named, "jmeter".</property>
  <property name="Username" required="Yes">The username to authorize.</property>
  <property name="Password" required="Yes">The password to authorize.</property>

<b>Controls:</b>

  <li>Add Button - Add an entry to the authorization table.</li>
  <li>Delete Button - Delete the currently selected table entry.</li>
  <li>Load Button - Load a previously saved authorization table and add the entries to the existing
authorization table entries.</li>
  <li>Save As Button - Save the current authorization table to a file.</li>
</ul>

<note>When you save the Test Plan, JMeter automatically saves all of the authorization
table entries.</note>

<example title="Authorization Example" anchor="authorization_example">

<p><a href="../demos/AuthManagerTestPlan.jmx">Download</a> this example.  In this example, we created a Test Plan on a local server that sends three HTTP requests, two requiring a login and the
other is open to everyone.  See figure 6 to see the makeup of our Test Plan.  On our server, we have a restricted
directory named, "secret", which contains two files, "index.html" and "index2.html".  We created a login id named, "kevin",
which has a password of "spot".  So, in our Authorization Manager, we created an entry for the restricted directory and
a username and password (see figure 7).  The two HTTP requests named "SecretPage1" and "SecretPage2" make requests
to "/secret/index1.html" and "/secret/index2.html".  The other HTTP request, named "NoSecretPage" makes a request to
"/index.html".</p>

<figure image="http-config/auth-manager-example1b.gif">Figure 7 - Authorization Manager Control Panel</figure>

<p>When we run the Test Plan, JMeter looks in the Authorization table for the URL it is requesting.  If the Base URL matches
the URL, then JMeter passes this information along with the request.</p>

be able to run it.  However, you can use it as a reference in constructing your own Test Plan.</note>

             <li>Add separators between groups: add a controller named "--------------" to create a visual separation between the groups. Otherwise the samplers are all stored sequentially.</li>
             <li>Put each group in a new controller: create a new <complink name="Simple Controller"/> for each group, and store all samplers for that group in it.</li>

        those that meet the requirements of the Include/Exclude fields are <i>recorded</i>.  If both Include and Exclude are
        left empty, then everything is recorded (which can result in dozens of samples recorded for each page, as images, stylesheets,
        etc are recorded).  <b>If there is at least one entry in the Include field, then only requests that match one or more Include patterns are
        recorded</b>.</property>
        <property name="Patterns to Exclude" required="No">Regular expressions that are matched against the URL that is sampled.

        <property name="Start Button" required="N/A">Start the proxy server.  JMeter writes the following message to the console once the proxy server has started up and is ready to take requests: "Proxy up and running!".</property>
        <property name="Stop Button" required="N/A">Stop the proxy server.</property>
        <property name="Restart Button" required="N/A">Stops and restarts the proxy server.  This is
  useful when you change/add/delete an include/exclude filter expression.</property>
</properties>

<p>To add an entry to the Include or Exclude field, type the entry into the text field, and hit &quot;Enter&quot; when done.
The text will be added to the List box to the right of the text field.  To clear the text field, hit the &quot;clear&quot;
button.  Currently, there is no way to individually select items and delete them.</p>

<p>These entries will be treated as Perl-type regular expressions.  They will be matched against the host name + the path of
each browser request.  Thus, if the URL you are browsing is <b>http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/index.html?username=xxxx</b>,
then the regular expression will be tested against the string: <b>&quot;jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/index.html&quot;</b>.  Thus,
if you wanted to include all .html files, you're regular expression might look like: <b>&quot;.*\.html&quot;</b>.  Using a
combination of includes and excludes, you should be able to record what you are interested in and skip what you are
not.</p>

<p>
N.B. the string that is matched by the regular expression must be the same as the <b>whole</b> host+path string.<br></br>Thus <b>&quot;\.html&quot;</b> will <b>not</b> match <b>j.a.o/index.html</b>
</p>

<p>It is also possible to have the proxy add timers to the recorded script. To
do this, create a timer directly within the HTTP Proxy Server component.
The proxy will place a copy of this timer into each sample it records, or into
the first sample of each group if you're using grouping. This copy will then be
scanned for occurences of variable ${T} in its properties, and any such
occurences will be replaced by the time gap from the previous sampler
recorded (in milliseconds).</p>

<p>When you are ready to begin, hit &quot;start&quot;.</p>
<note>You will need to edit the proxy settings of your browser to point at the
appropriate server and port, where the server is the machine JMeter is running on, and
the port # is from the Proxy Control Panel shown above.</note>

<b>Where Do Samples Get Recorded?</b>
<p>JMeter places the recorded samples in the Target Controller you choose. If you choose the default option
"Use Recording Controller", they will be stored in the first Recording Controller found in the test object tree (so be
sure to add a Recording Controller before you start recording).</p>

<p>If the HTTP Proxy Server finds enabled <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/> directly within the
controller where samples are being stored, or directly within any of its parent controllers, the recorded samples
will have empty fields for the default values you specified. You may further control this behaviour by placing an
HTTP Request Defaults element directly within the HTTP Proxy Server, whose non-blank values will override
those in the other HTTP Request Defaults. See <a href="best-practices.html#proxy_server"> Best
Practices with the Proxy Server</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the HTTP Proxy Server finds <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> directly within the
controller where samples are being stored, or directly within any of its parent controllers, the recorded samples
will have any occurences of the values of those variables replaced by the corresponding variable. Again, you can
place User Defined Variables directly within the HTTP Proxy Server to override the values to be replaced. See
<a href="best-practices.html#proxy_server"> Best Practices with the Proxy Server</a> for more info.</p>

<p>When you are done recording your test samples, stop the proxy server (hit the &quot;stop&quot; button).  Remember to reset
your browser's proxy settings.  Now, you may want to sort and re-order the test script, add timers, listeners, a
cookie manager, etc.</p>

<b>How can I record the server's responses too?</b>
<p>The HTTP Proxy Server actually performs a sampling to obtain the server's response, and will notify any
listeners directly inside the controller where the samples are being stored. So you just need to place a 
<complink name="View Results Tree"/> listener there to get the responses recorded.</p>

<component index="15.5.1" name="Response Assertion" anchor="basic_assertion" screenshot="assertion/assertion.gif">

<description><p>The response assertion control panel lets you add pattern strings to be compared against various
	fields of the response.
	The pattern strings are Perl5-style regular expressions. You can also choose whether the strings will be expected
to <b>match</b> the entire response, or if the response is only expected to <b>contain</b> the
pattern. You can attach multiple assertions to any controller for additional flexibility.</p>
<p>Note that the pattern string should not include the enclosing delimiters, 
	i.e. use <b>Price: \d+</b> not <b>/Price: \d+/</b>.
	By default, the pattern is in multi-line mode, which means that the "." meta-character does not match newline.
    In multi-line mode, "^" and "$" match the start or end of any line anywhere within the string 
    - not just the start and end of the entire string.
	Case is also significant. To override these settings, one can use the extended regular expression syntax.
	For example:
</p>
<pre>
	(?i) - ignore case
	(?s) - treat target as single line, i.e. "." matches new-line
	(?is) - both the above
    These can be used anywhere within the expression, e.g.
    (?i)apple(?-i) Pie - matches "ApPLe Pie", but not "ApPLe pIe"
</pre>

                <p>
                The overall success of the sample is determined by combining the result of the

                When the Ignore Status checkbox is selected, the Response status is forced
                to successful before evaluating the Assertion.

<section name="15.7 Pre Processors" anchor="preprocessors">
<component index="15.7.1" name="HTML Link Parser" anchor="html_link_parser">
<description>
<p>This modifier parses HTML response from the server and extracts
links and forms.  A URL test sample that passes through this modifier will be examined to
see if it &quot;matches&quot; any of the links or forms extracted
from the immediately previous response.  It would then replace the values in the URL
test sample with appropriate values from the matching link or form.  Perl-type regular
expressions are used to find matches.</p>
</description>

<example title="Spidering Example" anchor="spider_example">
<p>Consider a simple example: let's say you wanted JMeter to &quot;spider&quot; through your site,
hitting link after link parsed from the HTML returned from your server (this is not
actually the most useful thing to do, but it serves as a good example).  You would create
a <complink name="Simple Controller"/>, and add the &quot;HTML Link Parser&quot; to it.  Then, create an
HTTP Request, and set the domain to &quot;.*&quot;, and the path likewise. This will
cause your test sample to match with any link found on the returned pages.  If you wanted to
restrict the spidering to a particular domain, then change the domain value
to the one you want.  Then, only links to that domain will be followed.
</p>
</example>

<example title="Poll Example" anchor="poll_example">
<p>A more useful example: given a web polling application, you might have a page with
several poll options as radio buttons for the user to select.  Let's say the values
of the poll options are very dynamic - maybe user generated.  If you wanted JMeter to
test the poll, you could either create test samples with hardcoded values chosen, or you
could let the HTML Link Parser parse the form, and insert a random poll option into
your URL test sample.  To do this, follow the above example, except, when configuring
your Web Test controller's URL options, be sure to choose &quot;POST&quot; as the
method.  Put in hard-coded values for the domain, path, and any additional form parameters.
Then, for the actual radio button parameter, put in the name (let's say it's called &quot;poll_choice&quot;),
and then &quot;.*&quot; for the value of that parameter.  When the modifier examines
this URL test sample, it will find that it &quot;matches&quot; the poll form (and
it shouldn't match any other form, given that you've specified all the other aspects of
the URL test sample), and it will replace your form parameters with the matching
parameters from the form.  Since the regular expression &quot;.*&quot; will match with
anything, the modifier will probably have a list of radio buttons to choose from.  It
will choose at random, and replace the value in your URL test sample.  Each time through
the test, a new random value will be chosen.</p>

<figure image="modification.png">Figure 8 - Online Poll Example</figure>

<note>One important thing to remember is that you must create a test sample immediately
prior that will return an HTML page with the links and forms that are relevant to
your dynamic test sample.</note>

<component index="15.7.2" name="HTTP URL Re-writing Modifier" screenshot="url_rewriter.png">
<description><p>This modifier works similarly to the HTML Link Parser, except it has a specific purpose for which
it is easier to use than the HTML Link Parser, and more efficient.  For web applications that
use URL Re-writing to store session ids instead of cookies, this element can be attached at the
ThreadGroup level, much like the <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/>.  Simply give it the name
of the session id parameter, and it will find it on the page and add the argument to every
request of that ThreadGroup.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this modifier can be attached to select requests and it will modify only them.
Clever users will even determine that this modifier can be used to grab values that elude the
<complink name="HTML Link Parser"/>.</p>

<description><p>A Thread Group defines a pool of users that will execute a particular test case against your server.  In the Thread Group GUI, you can control the number of users simulated (num of threads), the ramp up time (how long it takes to start all the threads), the number of times to perform the test, and optionally, a start and stop time for the test.</p></description>

<component index="15.9.4" name="SSL Manager" screenshot="">
<p>
  The SSL Manager is a way to select a client certificate so that you can test
  applications that use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  In order to use it,
  you must have JSSE 1.0.2 installed.  Unfortunately, there is no standard method
  for controling who a client is--and that won't be introduced until JDK 1.4 is
  officially available.  The SSL Manager should still work with JDK 1.4, so this
  is the best solution we could come up with.
</p>

<b>Choosing a Client Certificate</b>
<p>
  You may either use a Java Key Store (JKS) format key store, or a Public Key
  Certificate Standard #12 (PKCS12) file for your client certificates.  There
  is a bug in the JSSE libraries that require you to have at least a six character
  password on your key (at least for the keytool utility that comes with your
  JDK).
</p>
<p>
  To select the client certificate, choose Options-&gt;SSL Manager from the menu bar.
  You will be presented with a file finder that looks for PKCS12 files by default.
  Your PKCS12 file must have the extension '.p12' for SSL Manager to recognize it
  as a PKCS12 file.  Any other file will be treated like an average JKS key store.
  If JSSE is correctly installed, you will be prompted for the password.  The text
  box does not hide the characters you type at this point--so make sure no one is
  looking over your shoulder.  The current implementation assumes that the password
  for the keystore is also the password for the private key of the client you want
  to authenticate as.
</p>
<p>
  The next time you run your test, the SSL Manager will examine your key store to
  see if it has more than one key available to it.  If there is only one key, SSL
  Manager will select it for you.  If there is more than one key, you will be prompted
  to select the alias you wish to authenticate as.  If SSL Manager cannot detect
  any keys in your keystore, it will give you a text box for the off chance you know
  something it doesn't.  Keep in mind that for the first run, you will be prompted
  once per thread.  Try to use only one thread for the first run to ensure everything
  is working properly.
</p>
<b>Things to Look Out For</b>
<p>
  You must have your Certificate Authority (CA) certificate installed properly
  if it is not signed by one of the five CA certificates that ships with your
  JDK.  One method to install it is to import your CA certificate into a JKS
  file, and name the JKS file "jssecacerts".  Place the file in your JRE's
  lib/security folder.  This file will be read before the "cacerts" file in
  the same directory.  Keep in mind that as long as the "jssecacerts" file
  exists, the certificates installed in "cacerts" will not be used.  This may
  cause problems for you.  If you don't mind importing your CA certificate into
  the "cacerts" file, then you can authenticate against all of the CA certificates
  installed.
