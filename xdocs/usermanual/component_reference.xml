 <note>
 Several test elements use JMeter properties to control their behaviour.
 These properties are normally resolved when the class is loaded.
 This generally occurs before the test plan starts, so it's not possible to change the settings by using the <code><funclink name="__setProperty()"/></code> function.

    Samplers perform the actual work of JMeter.
    Each sampler (except <complink name="Test Action" />) generates one or more sample results.
    The sample results have various attributes (success/fail, elapsed time, data size etc.) and can be viewed in the various listeners.

This controller lets you send an FTP "retrieve file" or "upload file" request to an FTP server.
If you are going to send multiple requests to the same FTP server, consider
using a <complink name="FTP Request Defaults"/> Configuration
Element so you do not have to enter the same information for each FTP Request Generative
Controller. When downloading a file, it can be stored on disk (Local File) or in the Response Data, or both.
<p>
Latency is set to the time it takes to login.

<description>
        <p>This sampler lets you send an HTTP/HTTPS request to a web server.  It
        also lets you control whether or not JMeter parses HTML files for images and
        other embedded resources and sends HTTP requests to retrieve them.
        The following types of embedded resource are retrieved:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>images</li>
        <li>applets</li>
        <li>stylesheets (CSS) and resources referenced from those files</li>
        <li>external scripts</li>
        <li>frames, iframes</li>
        <li>background images (body, table, TD, TR)</li>
        <li>background sound</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The default parser is <code>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.parser.LagartoBasedHtmlParser</code>.
        This can be changed by using the property "<code>htmlparser.className</code>" - see <code>jmeter.properties</code> for details.
        </p>
        <p>If you are going to send multiple requests to the same web server, consider
        using an <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/>
        Configuration Element so you do not have to enter the same information for each
        HTTP Request.</p>

        <p>Or, instead of manually adding HTTP Requests, you may want to use
        JMeter's <complink name="HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder"/> to create
        them.  This can save you time if you have a lot of HTTP requests or requests with many
        parameters.</p>

        <p><b>There are two different test elements used to define the samplers:</b></p>
        <dl>
        <dt>AJP/1.3 Sampler</dt><dd>uses the Tomcat mod_jk protocol (allows testing of Tomcat in AJP mode without needing Apache httpd)
        The AJP Sampler does not support multiple file upload; only the first file will be used.
        </dd>
        <dt>HTTP Request</dt><dd>this has an implementation drop-down box, which selects the HTTP protocol implementation to be used:
          <dl>
            <dt><code>Java</code></dt><dd>uses the HTTP implementation provided by the JVM.
            This has some limitations in comparison with the HttpClient implementations - see below.</dd>
            <dt><code>HTTPClient4</code></dt><dd>uses Apache HttpComponents HttpClient 4.x.</dd>
            <dt>Blank Value</dt><dd>does not set implementation on HTTP Samplers, so relies on HTTP Request Defaults if present or on <code>jmeter.httpsampler</code> property defined in <code>jmeter.properties</code></dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
        </dl>
         <p>The Java HTTP implementation has some limitations:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>There is no control over how connections are re-used.
         When a connection is released by JMeter, it may or may not be re-used by the same thread.</li>
         <li>The API is best suited to single-threaded usage - various settings
         are defined via system properties, and therefore apply to all connections.</li>
         <li>There is a bug in the handling of HTTPS via a Proxy (the <code>CONNECT</code> is not handled correctly).
         See Java bugs 6226610 and 6208335.
         </li>
         <li>It does not support virtual hosts.</li>
         <li>It supports only the following methods: <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code> and <code>TRACE</code></li>
         <li>It does not support client based certificate testing with Keystore Config.</li>
         </ul>
         <note>Note: the <code>FILE</code> protocol is intended for testing purposes only.
         It is handled by the same code regardless of which HTTP Sampler is used.</note>
        <p>If the request requires server or proxy login authorization (i.e. where a browser would create a pop-up dialog box),
         you will also have to add an <complink name="HTTP Authorization Manager"/> Configuration Element.
         For normal logins (i.e. where the user enters login information in a form), you will need to work out what the form submit button does,
         and create an HTTP request with the appropriate method (usually <code>POST</code>) 
         and the appropriate parameters from the form definition.
         If the page uses HTTP, you can use the JMeter Proxy to capture the login sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
        A separate SSL context is used for each thread.
        If you want to use a single SSL context (not the standard behaviour of browsers), set the JMeter property:</p>
<source>
https.sessioncontext.shared=true
</source>
        By default, since version 5.0, the SSL context is retained during a Thread Group iteration and reset for each test iteration.
        If in your test plan the same user iterates multiple times, then you should set this to false.
<source>
httpclient.reset_state_on_thread_group_iteration=true
</source>
        <note>
         Note: this does not apply to the Java HTTP implementation.
        </note>
        JMeter defaults to the SSL protocol level TLS.
        If the server needs a different level, e.g. <code>SSLv3</code>, change the JMeter property, for example:
<source>
https.default.protocol=SSLv3
</source>
        <p>
        JMeter also allows one to enable additional protocols, by changing the property <code>https.socket.protocols</code>.
        </p>
        <p>If the request uses cookies, then you will also need an
        <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/>.  You can
        add either of these elements to the Thread Group or the HTTP Request. If you have
        more than one HTTP Request that needs authorizations or cookies, then add the
        elements to the Thread Group. That way, all HTTP Request controllers will share the
        same Authorization Manager and Cookie Manager elements.</p>

        <p>If the request uses a technique called "URL Rewriting" to maintain sessions,
        then see section
        <a href="build-adv-web-test-plan.html#session_url_rewriting">6.1 Handling User Sessions With URL Rewriting</a>
        for additional configuration steps.</p>

        <property name="Server" required="No">
             Domain name or IP address of the web server, e.g. <code>www.example.com</code>. [Do not include the <code>http://</code> prefix.]
             Note: If the "<code>Host</code>" header is defined in a Header Manager, then this will be used
             as the virtual host name.
             <note>Server is required, unless:
              <ul>
                <li>it is provided by <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/></li>

        <property name="Response Timeout" required="No">Response Timeout. Number of milliseconds to wait for a response.
        Note that this applies to each wait for a response. If the server response is sent in several chunks, the overall
        elapsed time may be longer than the timeout.
        <p>A <complink name="Duration Assertion"/> can be used to detect responses that take too long to complete.</p>

        <property name="Username" required="No">(Optional) username for proxy server.</property>
        <property name="Password" required="No">(Optional) password for proxy server. (N.B. this is stored unencrypted in the test plan)</property>
        <property name="Implementation" required="No"><code>Java</code>, <code>HttpClient4</code>.
        If not specified (and not defined by HTTP Request Defaults), the default depends on the value of the JMeter property
        <code>jmeter.httpsampler</code>, failing that, the HttpClient4 implementation is used.</property>
        <property name="Protocol" required="No"><code>HTTP</code>, <code>HTTPS</code> or <code>FILE</code>. Default: <code>HTTP</code></property>
        <property name="Method" required="Yes"><code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, <code>TRACE</code>,

            <code>httpsampler.user_defined_methods</code>.</p>
        </property>
        <property name="Content Encoding" required="No">
        Content encoding to be used (for <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code> and <code>FILE</code>).
        This is the character encoding to be used, and is not related to the Content-Encoding HTTP header.
        </property>
        <property name="Redirect Automatically" required="No">
        Sets the underlying http protocol handler to automatically follow redirects,
        so they are not seen by JMeter, and thus will not appear as samples.
        Should only be used for <code>GET</code> and <code>HEAD</code> requests.
        The HttpClient sampler will reject attempts to use it for <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code>.
        <note>Warning: see below for information on cookie and header handling.</note>
        </property>
        <property name="Follow Redirects" required="No">
        This only has any effect if "<code>Redirect Automatically</code>" is not enabled.
        If set, the JMeter sampler will check if the response is a redirect and follow it if so.
        The initial redirect and further responses will appear as additional samples.
        The URL and data fields of the parent sample will be taken from the final (non-redirected)
        sample, but the parent byte count and elapsed time include all samples.
        The latency is taken from the initial response.
        Note that the HttpClient sampler may log the following message:
        <source>"Redirect requested but followRedirects is disabled"</source>
        This can be ignored.
        <br/>
        JMeter will collapse paths of the form '<code>/../segment</code>' in
        both absolute and relative redirect URLs. For example <code>http://host/one/../two</code> will be collapsed into <code>http://host/two</code>.
        If necessary, this behaviour can be suppressed by setting the JMeter property
        <code>httpsampler.redirect.removeslashdotdot=false</code>
        </property>
        <property name="Use KeepAlive" required="No">JMeter sets the Connection: <code>keep-alive</code> header. This does not work properly with the default HTTP implementation, as connection re-use is not under user-control.
                  It does work with the Apache HttpComponents HttpClient implementations.</property>
        <property name="Use multipart/form-data for HTTP POST" required="No">
        Use a <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> post request
        </property>
        <property name="Browser-compatible headers" required="No">
        When using <code>multipart/form-data</code>, this suppresses the <code>Content-Type</code> and
        <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> headers; only the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header is sent.
        </property>
        <property name="Path" required="Yes">The path to resource (for example, <code>/servlets/myServlet</code>). If the
resource requires query string parameters, add them below in the
"Send Parameters With the Request" section.
<note>
As a special case, if the path starts with "<code>http://</code>" or "<code>https://</code>" then this is used as the full URL.
</note>
In this case, the server, port and protocol fields are ignored; parameters are also ignored for <code>GET</code> and <code>DELETE</code> methods.
Also please note that the path is not encoded - apart from replacing spaces with <code>%20</code> -
so unsafe characters may need to be encoded to avoid errors such as <code>URISyntaxException</code>.
</property>
        <property name="Send Parameters With the Request" required="No">The query string will
        be generated from the list of parameters you provide.  Each parameter has a <code>name</code> and
        <code>value</code>, the options to encode the parameter, and an option to include or exclude an equals sign (some applications
        don't expect an equals sign when the value is the empty string).  The query string will be generated in the correct fashion, depending on
        the choice of "Method" you made (i.e. if you chose <code>GET</code> or <code>DELETE</code>, the query string will be
        appended to the URL, if <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code>, then it will be sent separately).  Also, if you are
        sending a file using a multipart form, the query string will be created using the
        multipart form specifications.
        <b>See below for some further information on parameter handling.</b>
        <p>
        Additionally, you can specify whether each parameter should be URL encoded.  If you are not sure what this
        means, it is probably best to select it.  If your values contain characters such as the following then encoding is usually required.:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII Control Chars</li>
            <li>Non-ASCII characters</li>
            <li>Reserved characters:URLs use some characters for special use in defining their syntax. When these characters are not used in their special role inside a URL, they need to be encoded, example : '<code>$</code>', '<code>&amp;</code>', '<code>+</code>', '<code>,</code>' , '<code>/</code>', '<code>:</code>', '<code>;</code>', '<code>=</code>', '<code>?</code>', '<code>@</code>'</li>
            <li>Unsafe characters: Some characters present the possibility of being misunderstood within URLs for various reasons. These characters should also always be encoded, example : '<code> </code>', '<code>&lt;</code>', '<code>&gt;</code>', '<code>#</code>', '<code>%</code>', &hellip;</li>
        </ul>
        </property>
        <property name="File Path:" required="No">Name of the file to send.  If left blank, JMeter
        does not send a file, if filled in, JMeter automatically sends the request as
        a multipart form request.
        <p>
        If it is a <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> request and there is a single file whose 'Parameter name' attribute (below) is omitted, 
        then the file is sent as the entire body
        of the request, i.e. no wrappers are added. This allows arbitrary bodies to be sent. This functionality is present for <code>POST</code> requests, 
        and also for <code>PUT</code> requests.
        <b>See below for some further information on parameter handling.</b>
        </p>
        </property>
        <property name="Parameter name:" required="No">Value of the "<code>name</code>" web request parameter.</property>
        <property name="MIME Type" required="No">MIME type (for example, <code>text/plain</code>).
        If it is a <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> request and either the '<code>name</code>' attribute (below) are omitted or the request body is
        constructed from parameter values only, then the value of this field is used as the value of the
        <code>content-type</code> request header.
        </property>
        <property name="Retrieve All Embedded Resources from HTML Files" required="No">Tell JMeter to parse the HTML file
and send HTTP/HTTPS requests for all images, Java applets, JavaScript files, CSSs, etc. referenced in the file.
        See below for more details.
        </property>
       <property name="Save response as MD5 hash?" required="No">
       If this is selected, then the response is not stored in the sample result.
       Instead, the 32 character MD5 hash of the data is calculated and stored instead.
       This is intended for testing large amounts of data.
       </property>
        <property name="Embedded URLs must match:" required="No">
        If present, this must be a regular expression that is used to match against any embedded URLs found.
        So if you only want to download embedded resources from <code>http://example.com/</code>, use the expression:
        <code>http://example\.com/.*</code>
        </property>
        <property name="Use concurrent pool" required="No">Use a pool of concurrent connections to get embedded resources.</property>
        <property name="Size" required="No">Pool size for concurrent connections used to get embedded resources.</property>
        <property name="Source address type" required="No">
        <i>[Only for HTTP Request with HTTPClient implementation]</i> <br></br>
        To distinguish the source address value, select the type of these:
        <ul>
        <li>Select <i>IP/Hostname</i> to use a specific IP address or a (local) hostname</li>
        <li>Select <i>Device</i> to pick the first available address for that interface which
        this may be either IPv4 or IPv6</li>
        <li>Select <i>Device IPv4</i> to select the IPv4 address of the device name (like <code>eth0</code>, <code>lo</code>, <code>em0</code>, etc.)</li>
        <li>Select <i>Device IPv6</i> to select the IPv6 address of the device name (like <code>eth0</code>, <code>lo</code>, <code>em0</code>, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        </property>
        <property name="Source address field" required="No">
        <i>[Only for HTTP Request with HTTPClient implementation]</i> <br></br>
        This property is used to enable IP Spoofing.
        It overrides the default local IP address for this sample.
        The JMeter host must have multiple IP addresses (i.e. IP aliases, network interfaces, devices).
        The value can be a host name, IP address, or a network interface device such as "<code>eth0</code>" or "<code>lo</code>" or "<code>wlan0</code>".<br></br>
        If the property <code>httpclient.localaddress</code> is defined, that is used for all HttpClient requests.
        </property>
</properties>
<note>
When using Automatic Redirection, cookies are only sent for the initial URL.
This can cause unexpected behaviour for web-sites that redirect to a local server.
E.g. if <code>www.example.com</code> redirects to <code>www.example.co.uk</code>.
In this case the server will probably return cookies for both URLs, but JMeter will only see the cookies for the last
host, i.e. <code>www.example.co.uk</code>. If the next request in the test plan uses <code>www.example.com</code>,
rather than <code>www.example.co.uk</code>, it will not get the correct cookies.
Likewise, Headers are sent for the initial request, and won't be sent for the redirect.
This is generally only a problem for manually created test plans,
as a test plan created using a recorder would continue from the redirected URL.
</note>
<p>
<b>Parameter Handling:</b><br></br>
For the <code>POST</code> and <code>PUT</code> method, if there is no file to send, and the name(s) of the parameter(s) are omitted,
then the body is created by concatenating all the value(s) of the parameters.
Note that the values are concatenated without adding any end-of-line characters.
These can be added by using the <code><funclink name="__char()"/></code> function in the value fields.
This allows arbitrary bodies to be sent.
The values are encoded if the encoding flag is set.
See also the MIME Type above how you can control the <code>content-type</code> request header that is sent.
<br></br>
For other methods, if the name of the parameter is missing,
then the parameter is ignored. This allows the use of optional parameters defined by variables.
</p>
<br/>
<p>You have the option to switch to <code>Body Data</code> tab when a request has only unnamed parameters
(or no parameters at all).
This option is useful in the following cases (amongst others):</p>
<ul>
<li>GWT RPC HTTP Request</li>
<li>JSON REST HTTP Request</li>
<li>XML REST HTTP Request</li>
<li>SOAP HTTP Request</li>
</ul>
<note>
Note that once you leave the Tree node, you cannot switch back to the parameter tab unless you clear the <code>Body Data</code> tab from its data.
</note>
<p>
In <code>Body Data</code> mode, each line will be sent with <code>CRLF</code> appended, apart from the last line.
To send a <code>CRLF</code> after the last line of data, just ensure that there is an empty line following it.
(This cannot be seen, except by noting whether the cursor can be placed on the subsequent line.)

<p>
<b>Method Handling:</b><br></br>
The <code>GET</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>PATCH</code> request methods work similarly, except that as of 3.1, only <code>POST</code> method supports multipart requests
or file upload.
The <code>PUT</code> and <code>PATCH</code> method body must be provided as one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>define the body as a file with empty Parameter name field; in which case the MIME Type is used as the Content-Type</li>
<li>define the body as parameter value(s) with no name</li>
<li>use the <code>Body Data</code> tab</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>GET</code>, <code>DELETE</code> and <code>POST</code> methods have an additional way of passing parameters by using the <code>Parameters</code> tab.
<code>GET</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>PATCH</code> require a Content-Type.
If not using a file, attach a Header Manager to the sampler and define the Content-Type there.
</p>
<p>JMeter scan responses from embedded resources. It uses the property <code>HTTPResponse.parsers</code>, which is a list of parser ids,
 e.g. <code>htmlParser</code>, <code>cssParser</code> and <code>wmlParser</code>. For each id found, JMeter checks two further properties:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><code>id.types</code> - a list of content types</li>
 <li><code>id.className</code> - the parser to be used to extract the embedded resources</li>
 </ul>
 <p>See <code>jmeter.properties</code> file for the details of the settings.
 If the <code>HTTPResponse.parser</code> property is not set, JMeter reverts to the previous behaviour,
 i.e. only <code>text/html</code> responses will be scanned</p>
<b>Emulating slow connections:</b><br></br>
<p>
<code>HttpClient4</code> and <code>Java</code> Sampler support emulation of slow connections; see the following entries in <code>jmeter.properties</code>:
<source>
# Define characters per second &gt; 0 to emulate slow connections
#httpclient.socket.http.cps=0
#httpclient.socket.https.cps=0
</source>
However the <code>Java</code> sampler only supports slow HTTPS connections.
</p>
<p><b>Response size calculation</b><br></br>

<note>
The <code>Java</code> implementation does not include transport overhead such as
chunk headers in the response body size.<br></br>
The <code>HttpClient4</code> implementation does include the overhead in the response body size,
so the value may be greater than the number of bytes in the response content.
</note>
</p>
<p>
<b>Retry handling</b><br></br>
By default retry has been set to 0 for both HttpClient4 and Java implementations, meaning no retry is attempted.<br/>  
For HttpClient4, the retry count can be overridden by setting the relevant JMeter property, for example:

<source>
httpclient4.retrycount=3
</source>
<note>
With HC4 Implementation, retry will be done on Idempotent Http Methods by default.
If you want to retry for all methods, then set property
<source>
httpclient4.request_sent_retry_enabled=true
</source></note>

Note that the Java implementation does not retry neither by default, you can change this by setting <source>http.java.sampler.retries=3</source>
</p>
<p>
<b>Note: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints</b><br></br>
You may encounter the following error: <code>java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificates does not conform to algorithm constraints</code>
 if you run a HTTPS request on a web site with a SSL certificate (itself or one of SSL certificates in its chain of trust) with a signature
 algorithm using MD2 (like <code>md2WithRSAEncryption</code>) or with a SSL certificate with a size lower than 1024 bits.
</p><p>
This error is related to increased security in Java 8.
</p><p>
To allow you to perform your HTTPS request, you can downgrade the security of your Java installation by editing
the Java <code>jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms</code> property. Remove the MD2 value or the constraint on size, depending on your case.
</p><p>
This property is in this file:</p>
<source>JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</source>
<p>See  <bugzilla>56357</bugzilla> for details.

<description><p>This sampler lets you send a JDBC Request (an SQL query) to a database.</p>
<p>Before using this you need to set up a
<complink name="JDBC Connection Configuration"/> Configuration element
</p>
<p>
If the Variable Names list is provided, then for each row returned by a Select statement, the variables are set up
with the value of the corresponding column (if a variable name is provided), and the count of rows is also set up.
For example, if the Select statement returns 2 rows of 3 columns, and the variable list is <code>A,,C</code>,
then the following variables will be set up:</p>
<source>
A_#=2 (number of rows)
A_1=column 1, row 1
A_2=column 1, row 2
C_#=2 (number of rows)
C_1=column 3, row 1
C_2=column 3, row 2
</source>
<p>
If the Select statement returns zero rows, then the <code>A_#</code> and <code>C_#</code> variables would be set to <code>0</code>, and no other variables would be set.
</p>
<p>
Old variables are cleared if necessary - e.g. if the first select retrieves six rows and a second select returns only three rows,
the additional variables for rows four, five and six will be removed.

By writing your own implementation of this interface,
you can use JMeter to harness multiple threads, input parameter control, and

</p>
<p>
The <code>JavaTest</code> example sampler can be useful for checking test plans, because it allows one to set

  <p>There are four test scenarios of testing LDAP. The tests are given below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add Test
      <ol>
        <li>Inbuilt test:
          <p>This will add a pre-defined entry in the LDAP Server and calculate

        <li>User defined test:
          <p>This will add the entry in the LDAP Server. User has to enter all the
          attributes in the table.The entries are collected from the table to add. The
          execution time is calculated. The created entry will not be deleted after the
          test.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Modify Test
      <ol>
        <li>Inbuilt test:
          <p>This will create a pre-defined entry first, then will modify the
          created entry in the LDAP Server.And calculate the execution time. After
          execution
          of the test, the created entry will be deleted from the LDAP Server.</p>

<component name="Access Log Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.9"  width="702" height="305" screenshot="accesslogsampler.png">
<center><h2>(Beta Code)</h2></center>
<description><p>AccessLogSampler was designed to read access logs and generate http requests.
For those not familiar with the access log, it is the log the webserver maintains of every
request it accepted. This means every image, CSS file, JavaScript file, html file, &hellip;
The current implementation is complete, but some features have not been enabled. 
There is a filter for the access log parser, but I haven't figured out how to link to the pre-processor. 
Once I do, changes to the sampler will be made to enable that functionality.</p>
<p>Tomcat uses the common format for access logs. This means any webserver that uses the
common log format can use the AccessLogSampler. Server that use common log format include:
Tomcat, Resin, Weblogic, and SunOne. Common log format looks
like this:</p>
<source>127.0.0.1 - - [21/Oct/2003:05:37:21 -0500] "GET /index.jsp?%2Findex.jsp= HTTP/1.1" 200 8343</source>
<note>The current implementation of the parser only looks at the text within the quotes that contains one of the HTTP protocol methods (<code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, &hellip;).
Everything else is stripped out and ignored. For example, the response code is completely
ignored by the parser. </note>
<p>For the future, it might be nice to filter out entries that
do not have a response code of <code>200</code>. Extending the sampler should be fairly simple. There
are two interfaces you have to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.LogParser</code></li>
<li><code>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.Generator</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation of AccessLogSampler uses the generator to create a new
HTTPSampler. The servername, port and get images are set by AccessLogSampler. Next,
the parser is called with integer <code>1</code>, telling it to parse one entry. After that,
<code>HTTPSampler.sample()</code> is called to make the request.</p>
<source>
samp = (HTTPSampler) GENERATOR.generateRequest();
samp.setDomain(this.getDomain());
samp.setPort(this.getPort());
samp.setImageParser(this.isImageParser());
PARSER.parse(1);
res = samp.sample();
res.setSampleLabel(samp.toString());
</source>
The required methods in <code>LogParser</code> are:
<ul>
<li><code>setGenerator(Generator)</code></li>
<li><code>parse(int)</code></li> 
</ul>
<p>
Classes implementing <code>Generator</code> interface should provide concrete implementation
for all the methods. For an example of how to implement either interface, refer to
<code>StandardGenerator</code> and <code>TCLogParser</code>.
</p>

<properties>
        <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
        <property name="Server" required="Yes">Domain name or IP address of the web server.</property>
        <property name="Protocol" required="No (defaults to http">Scheme</property>
        <property name="Port" required="No (defaults to 80)">Port the web server is listening to.</property>
        <property name="Log parser class" required="Yes (default provided)">The log parser class is responsible for parsing the logs.</property>
        <property name="Filter" required="No">The filter class is used to filter out certain lines.</property>
        <property name="Location of log file" required="Yes">The location of the access log file.</property>
</properties>
<p>
The <code>TCLogParser</code> processes the access log independently for each thread.
The <code>SharedTCLogParser</code> and <code>OrderPreservingLogParser</code> share access to the file, 
i.e. each thread gets the next entry in the log.
</p>
<p>
The <code>SessionFilter</code> is intended to handle Cookies across threads. 
It does not filter out any entries, but modifies the cookie manager so that the cookies for a given IP are
processed by a single thread at a time. If two threads try to process samples from the same client IP address,
then one will be forced to wait until the other has completed.
</p>
<p>
The <code>LogFilter</code> is intended to allow access log entries to be filtered by filename and regex,
as well as allowing for the replacement of file extensions. However, it is not currently possible
to configure this via the GUI, so it cannot really be used.

<component name="BeanShell Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.10"  width="848" height="566" screenshot="beanshellsampler.png">
    <description><p>This sampler allows you to write a sampler using the BeanShell scripting language.
</p><p>
<b>For full details on using BeanShell, please see the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell website.</a></b>
</p>
<p>
The test element supports the <code>ThreadListener</code> and <code>TestListener</code> interface methods.
These must be defined in the initialisation file.
See the file <code>BeanShellListeners.bshrc</code> for example definitions.
</p>
<p>
The BeanShell sampler also supports the <code>Interruptible</code> interface.
The <code>interrupt()</code> method can be defined in the script or the init file.
</p>
    </description>
<properties>
    <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.
    The name is stored in the script variable Label</property>
    <property name="Reset bsh.Interpreter before each call" required="Yes">
    If this option is selected, then the interpreter will be recreated for each sample.
    This may be necessary for some long running scripts. 
    For further information, see <a href="best-practices#bsh_scripting">Best Practices - BeanShell scripting</a>.
    </property>
    <property name="Parameters" required="No">Parameters to pass to the BeanShell script.
    This is intended for use with script files; for scripts defined in the GUI, you can use whatever
    variable and function references you need within the script itself.
    The parameters are stored in the following variables:
    <dl>
        <dt><code>Parameters</code></dt><dd>string containing the parameters as a single variable</dd>
        <dt><code>bsh.args</code></dt><dd>String array containing parameters, split on white-space</dd>
    </dl></property>
    <property name="Script file" required="No">A file containing the BeanShell script to run.
    The file name is stored in the script variable <code>FileName</code></property>
    <property name="Script" required="Yes (unless script file is provided)">The BeanShell script to run. 
    The return value (if not <code>null</code>) is stored as the sampler result.</property>
</properties>
<note>
N.B. Each Sampler instance has its own BeanShell interpreter,
and Samplers are only called from a single thread
</note><p>
If the property "<code>beanshell.sampler.init</code>" is defined, it is passed to the Interpreter
as the name of a sourced file.
This can be used to define common methods and variables. 
There is a sample init file in the bin directory: <code>BeanShellSampler.bshrc</code>.
</p><p>
If a script file is supplied, that will be used, otherwise the script will be used.</p>
<note>
JMeter processes function and variable references before passing the script field to the interpreter,
so the references will only be resolved once.
Variable and function references in script files will be passed
verbatim to the interpreter, which is likely to cause a syntax error.
In order to use runtime variables, please use the appropriate props methods,
e.g.<code>props.get("START.HMS"); props.put("PROP1","1234");</code>
<br/>
BeanShell does not currently support Java 5 syntax such as generics and the enhanced for loop.
</note>
        <p>Before invoking the script, some variables are set up in the BeanShell interpreter:</p>
        <p>The contents of the Parameters field is put into the variable "<code>Parameters</code>".
            The string is also split into separate tokens using a single space as the separator, and the resulting list
            is stored in the String array <code>bsh.args</code>.</p>
        <p>The full list of BeanShell variables that is set up is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>log</code> - the <a href="https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">Logger</a></li>
        <li><code>Label</code> - the Sampler label</li>
        <li><code>FileName</code> - the file name, if any</li>
        <li><code>Parameters</code> - text from the Parameters field</li>
        <li><code>bsh.args</code> - the parameters, split as described above</li>
        <li><code>SampleResult</code> - pointer to the current <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html"><code>SampleResult</code></a></li>
            <li><code>ResponseCode</code> defaults to <code>200</code></li>
            <li><code>ResponseMessage</code> defaults to "<code>OK</code>"</li>
            <li><code>IsSuccess</code> defaults to <code>true</code></li>
            <li><code>ctx</code> - <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/threads/JMeterContext.html">JMeterContext</a></li>
            <li><code>vars</code> - <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/threads/JMeterVariables.html">JMeterVariables</a>  - e.g. 
               <source>vars.get("VAR1");
vars.put("VAR2","value");
vars.remove("VAR3");
vars.putObject("OBJ1",new Object());</source></li>
            <li><code>props</code> - JMeterProperties (class <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html"><code>java.util.Properties</code></a>) - e.g.
                <source>props.get("START.HMS");
props.put("PROP1","1234");</source></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the script completes, control is returned to the Sampler, and it copies the contents
            of the following script variables into the corresponding variables in the <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html"><code>SampleResult</code></a>:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><code>ResponseCode</code> - for example <code>200</code></li>
            <li><code>ResponseMessage</code> - for example "<code>OK</code>"</li>
            <li><code>IsSuccess</code> - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The SampleResult ResponseData is set from the return value of the script.
            If the script returns null, it can set the response directly, by using the method 
            <code>SampleResult.setResponseData(data)</code>, where data is either a String or a byte array.
            The data type defaults to "<code>text</code>", but can be set to binary by using the method
            <code>SampleResult.setDataType(SampleResult.BINARY)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>SampleResult</code> variable gives the script full access to all the fields and
                methods in the <code>SampleResult</code>. For example, the script has access to the methods
                <code>setStopThread(boolean)</code> and <code>setStopTest(boolean)</code>.

                Here is a simple (not very useful!) example script:</p>

<source>
if (bsh.args[0].equalsIgnoreCase("StopThread")) {
    log.info("Stop Thread detected!");
    SampleResult.setStopThread(true);
}
return "Data from sample with Label "+Label;
//or
SampleResult.setResponseData("My data");
return null;
</source>
<p>Another example:<br></br> ensure that the property <code>beanshell.sampler.init=BeanShellSampler.bshrc</code> is defined in <code>jmeter.properties</code>. 
The following script will show the values of all the variables in the <code>ResponseData</code> field:
</p>
<source>
return getVariables();
</source>
<p>
For details on the methods available for the various classes (<a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/threads/JMeterVariables.html"><code>JMeterVariables</code></a>, <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html"><code>SampleResult</code></a> etc.) please check the Javadoc or the source code.
Beware however that misuse of any methods can cause subtle faults that may be difficult to find.

<component name="JSR223 Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.11.1" width="861" height="502" screenshot="jsr223-sampler.png">
<description>
<p>
The JSR223 Sampler allows JSR223 script code to be used to perform a sample or some computation required to create/update variables.
<note>
If you don't want to generate a <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html">SampleResult</a> when this sampler is run, call the following method:
<source>SampleResult.setIgnore();</source>
</note>
</p>
<p>
The JSR223 test elements have a feature (compilation) that can significantly increase performance.
To benefit from this feature:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Script files instead of inlining them. This will make JMeter compile them if this feature is available on ScriptEngine and cache them.</li>
    <li>Or Use Script Text and check <code>Cache compiled script if available</code> property.
    <note>When using this feature, ensure your script code does not use JMeter variables directly in script code as caching would only cache first replacement. Instead use script parameters.</note>
    <note>To benefit from caching and compilation, the language engine used for scripting must implement JSR223 <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/script/Compilable.html">Compilable</a></code> interface (Groovy is one of these, java, beanshell and javascript are not)</note>
    <note>When using Groovy as scripting language and not checking <code>Cache compiled script if available</code> (while caching is recommended), you should set this JVM Property <code>-Dgroovy.use.classvalue=true</code>
        due to a Groovy Memory leak as of version 2.4.6, see:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7683" >GROOVY-7683</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7591">GROOVY-7591</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8136353">JDK-8136353</a></li>
        </ul> 
    </note>
    </li>
</ul>
Cache size is controlled by the following JMeter property (<code>jmeter.properties</code>):
<source>jsr223.compiled_scripts_cache_size=100</source>
<note>Unlike the <complink name="BeanShell Sampler" />, the interpreter is not saved between invocations.</note>
<note>
JSR223 Test Elements using Script file or Script text + checked <code>Cache compiled script if available</code> are now compiled if ScriptEngine supports this feature, this enables great performance enhancements.

JMeter processes function and variable references before passing the script field to the interpreter,

<p>
The <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html">SampleResult</a> ResponseData is set from the return value of the script.
If the script returns <code>null</code>, it can set the response directly, by using the method 
<code>SampleResult.setResponseData(data)</code>, where data is either a String or a byte array.
The data type defaults to "<code>text</code>", but can be set to binary by using the method
<code>SampleResult.setDataType(SampleResult.BINARY)</code>.
</p>
<p>
The SampleResult variable gives the script full access to all the fields and
methods in the SampleResult. For example, the script has access to the methods
<code>setStopThread(boolean)</code> and <code>setStopTest(boolean)</code>.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the BeanShell Sampler, the JSR223 Sampler does not set the <code>ResponseCode</code>, <code>ResponseMessage</code> and sample status via script variables.
Currently the only way to changes these is via the <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html">SampleResult</a> methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SampleResult.setSuccessful(true/false)</code></li>

    <description>
        <p>
        The TCP Sampler opens a TCP/IP connection to the specified server.
        It then sends the text, and waits for a response.
        </p><p>
        If "<code>Re-use connection</code>" is selected, connections are shared between Samplers in the same thread,
        provided that the exact same host name string and port are used. 
        Different hosts/port combinations will use different connections, as will different threads. 
        If both of "<code>Re-use connection</code>" and "<code>Close connection</code>" are selected, the socket will be closed after running the sampler. 
        On the next sampler, another socket will be created. You may want to close a socket at the end of each thread loop.
        </p><p>
        If an error is detected - or "<code>Re-use connection</code>" is not selected - the socket is closed.
        Another socket will be reopened on the next sample.
        </p><p>
        The following properties can be used to control its operation:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>tcp.status.prefix</code></dt><dd>text that precedes a status number</dd>
            <dt><code>tcp.status.suffix</code></dt><dd>text that follows a status number</dd>
            <dt><code>tcp.status.properties</code></dt><dd>name of property file to convert status codes to messages</dd>
            <dt><code>tcp.handler</code></dt><dd>Name of TCP Handler class (default <code>TCPClientImpl</code>) - only used if not specified on the GUI</dd>
        </dl>
        The class that handles the connection is defined by the GUI, failing that the property <code>tcp.handler</code>.
        If not found, the class is then searched for in the package <code>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.tcp.sampler</code>.
        <p>
        Users can provide their own implementation.
        The class must extend <code>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.tcp.sampler.TCPClient</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The following implementations are currently provided.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>TCPClientImpl</code></li>
        <li><code>BinaryTCPClientImpl</code></li>
        <li><code>LengthPrefixedBinaryTCPClientImpl</code></li>
        </ul>
        The implementations behave as follows:
        <dl>
        <dt><code>TCPClientImpl</code></dt>
        <dd>
        This implementation is fairly basic.
        When reading the response, it reads until the end of line byte, if this is defined
        by setting the property <code>tcp.eolByte</code>, otherwise until the end of the input stream.
        You can control charset encoding by setting <code>tcp.charset</code>, which will default to Platform default encoding.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>BinaryTCPClientImpl</code></dt>
        <dd>
        This implementation converts the GUI input, which must be a hex-encoded string, into binary,
        and performs the reverse when reading the response.
        When reading the response, it reads until the end of message byte, if this is defined
        by setting the property <code>tcp.BinaryTCPClient.eomByte</code>, otherwise until the end of the input stream.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>LengthPrefixedBinaryTCPClientImpl</code></dt>
        <dd>
        This implementation extends BinaryTCPClientImpl by prefixing the binary message data with a binary length byte.
        The length prefix defaults to 2 bytes.
        This can be changed by setting the property <code>tcp.binarylength.prefix.length</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Timeout handling</b></dt>
        <dd>
        If the timeout is set, the read will be terminated when this expires. 
        So if you are using an <code>eolByte</code>/<code>eomByte</code>, make sure the timeout is sufficiently long,
        otherwise the read will be terminated early.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Response handling</b></dt>
        <dd>
        If <code>tcp.status.prefix</code> is defined, then the response message is searched for the text following
        that up to the suffix. If any such text is found, it is used to set the response code.
        The response message is then fetched from the properties file (if provided).
        <example title="Usage of pre- and suffix" anchor="tcp-prefix-example">
        For example, if the prefix = "<code>[</code>" and the suffix = "<code>]</code>", then the following response:
        <source>[J28] XI123,23,GBP,CR</source>
        would have the response code <code>J28</code>.
        </example>
        Response codes in the range "<code>400</code>"-"<code>499</code>" and "<code>500</code>"-"<code>599</code>" are currently regarded as failures;
        all others are successful. [This needs to be made configurable!]

<p>
For the MapMessage type, JMeter reads the source as lines of text.
Each line must have 3 fields, delimited by commas.
The fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of entry</li>
<li>Object class name, e.g. "<code>String</code>" (assumes <code>java.lang</code> package if not specified)</li>
<li>Object string value</li>
</ul>
For each entry, JMeter adds an Object with the given name.
The value is derived by creating an instance of the class, and using the <code>valueOf(String)</code> method to convert the value if necessary.
For example:
<source>
name,String,Example
size,Integer,1234
</source>
This is a very simple implementation; it is not intended to support all possible object types.
<note> 
The Object message is implemented and works as follow:
<ul>
<li>Put the JAR that contains your object and its dependencies in <code>jmeter_home/lib/</code> folder</li>
<li>Serialize your object as XML using XStream</li>
<li>Either put result in a file suffixed with <code>.txt</code> or <code>.obj</code> or put XML content directly in Text Area</li>  
</ul>
Note that if message is in a file, replacement of properties will not occur while it will if you use Text Area.

  <property name="Name" required="">Descriptive name for this element that is shown in the tree.</property>
  <property name="QueueConnection Factory" required="Yes">
    The JNDI name of the queue connection factory to use for connecting to the messaging system.
  </property>
  <property name="JNDI Name Request queue" required="Yes">
    This is the JNDI name of the queue to which the messages are sent.

  <property name="JNDI Name Reply queue" required="No">
    The JNDI name of the receiving queue. If a value is provided here and the communication style is <code>Request Response</code>
    this queue will be monitored for responses to the requests sent.
  </property>
  <property name="Number of samples to aggregate" required="Yes">Number of samples to aggregate. Only applicable for Communication style Read.</property>
  <property name="JMS Selector" required="No">
    Message Selector as defined by JMS specification to extract only 
    messages that respect the Selector condition. Syntax uses subpart of SQL 92.
  </property>
  <property name="Communication style" required="Yes">
    The Communication style can be <code>Request Only</code> (also known as Fire and Forget), <code>Request Response</code>,
    <code>Read</code>, <code>Browse</code>, <code>Clear</code>:
    <dl>
    <dt><code>Request Only</code></dt><dd> will only send messages and will not monitor replies. As such it can be used to put load on a system.</dd>
    <dt><code>Request Response</code></dt><dd> will send messages and monitor the replies it receives. Behaviour depends on the value of the JNDI Name Reply Queue.
    If JNDI Name Reply Queue has a value, this queue is used to monitor the results. Matching of request and reply is done with
    the message id of the request and the correlation id of the reply. If the JNDI Name Reply Queue is empty, then
    temporary queues will be used for the communication between the requestor and the server.
    This is very different from the fixed reply queue. With temporary queues the sending thread will block until the reply message has been received.
    With <code>Request Response</code> mode, you need to have a Server that listens to messages sent to Request Queue and sends replies to 
    queue referenced by <code>message.getJMSReplyTo()</code>.</dd>
    <dt><code>Read</code></dt><dd> will read a message from an outgoing queue which has no listeners attached. This can be convenient for testing purposes.
     This method can be used if you need to handle queues without a binding file (in case the jmeter-jms-skip-jndi library is used),
     which only works with the JMS Point-to-Point sampler. In case binding files are used, one can also use the JMS Subscriber Sampler for reading from a queue.</dd>
    <dt><code>Browse</code></dt><dd> will determine the current queue depth without removing messages from the queue, returning the number of messages on the queue.</dd>
    <dt><code>Clear</code></dt><dd> will clear the queue, i.e. remove all messages from the queue.</dd>
    </dl>
  </property>
  <property name="Use alternate fields for message correlation" required="Yes">
    These check-boxes select the fields which will be used for matching the response message with the original request.

    <dt><code>Use Response Message Id</code></dt><dd>if selected, the response JMSMessageID will be used, 
    otherwise the response JMSCorrelationID will be used.
    </dd>
    </dl>
    There are two frequently used JMS Correlation patterns:
    <dl>
    <dt>JMS Correlation ID Pattern</dt>
    <dd> i.e. match request and response on their correlation Ids
    => deselect both checkboxes, and provide a correlation id.</dd>
    <dt>JMS Message ID Pattern</dt>
    <dd>i.e. match request message id with response correlation id
    => select "Use Request Message Id" only.
    </dd>
    </dl>
    In both cases the JMS application is responsible for populating the correlation ID as necessary.
    <note>if the same queue is used to send and receive messages, 
    then the response message will be the same as the request message.
    In which case, either provide a correlation id and clear both checkboxes;
    or select both checkboxes to use the message Id for correlation.

<component name="JUnit Request" index="&sect-num;.1.16"  width="397" height="536" screenshot="junit_sampler.png">
<description>
The current implementation supports standard JUnit convention and extensions. It also
includes extensions like <code>oneTimeSetUp</code> and <code>oneTimeTearDown</code>. The sampler works like the
<complink name="Java Request" /> with some differences.
<ul>
<li>rather than use JMeter's test interface, it scans the jar files for classes extending JUnit's <code>TestCase</code> class. That includes any class or subclass.</li>
<li>JUnit test jar files should be placed in <code>jmeter/lib/junit</code> instead of <code>/lib</code> directory.
You can also use the "<code>user.classpath</code>" property to specify where to look for <code>TestCase</code> classes.</li>
<li>JUnit sampler does not use name/value pairs for configuration like the <complink name="Java Request" />. The sampler assumes <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code> will configure the test correctly.</li>
<li>The sampler measures the elapsed time only for the test method and does not include <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code>.</li>
<li>Each time the test method is called, JMeter will pass the result to the listeners.</li>
<li>Support for <code>oneTimeSetUp</code> and <code>oneTimeTearDown</code> is done as a method. Since JMeter is multi-threaded, we cannot call <code>oneTimeSetUp</code>/<code>oneTimeTearDown</code> the same way Maven does it.</li>
<li>The sampler reports unexpected exceptions as errors.
There are some important differences between standard JUnit test runners and JMeter's
implementation. Rather than make a new instance of the class for each test, JMeter
creates 1 instance per sampler and reuses it.
This can be changed with checkbox "<code>Create a new instance per sample</code>".</li>
</ul>
The current implementation of the sampler will try to create an instance using the string constructor first. If the test class does not declare a string constructor, the sampler will look for an empty constructor. Example below:
<example title="JUnit Constructors" anchor="junit_constructor_example">
Empty Constructor:
<source>
public class myTestCase {
  public myTestCase() {}
}
</source>
String Constructor:
<source>
public class myTestCase {
  public myTestCase(String text) {
    super(text);
  }
}
</source>
</example>
By default, JMeter will provide some default values for the success/failure code and message. Users should define a set of unique success and failure codes and use them uniformly across all tests.
<note>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
If you use <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code>, make sure the methods are declared public. If you do not, the test may not run properly.
<br></br>
Here are some general guidelines for writing JUnit tests so they work well with JMeter. Since JMeter runs multi-threaded, it is important to keep certain things in mind.
<ul>
<li>Write the <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code> methods so they are thread safe. This generally means avoid using static members.</li>
<li>Make the test methods discrete units of work and not long sequences of actions. By keeping the test method to a discrete operation, it makes it easier to combine test methods to create new test plans.</li>
<li>Avoid making test methods depend on each other. Since JMeter allows arbitrary sequencing of test methods, the runtime behavior is different than the default JUnit behavior.</li>
<li>If a test method is configurable, be careful about where the properties are stored. Reading the properties from the Jar file is recommended.</li>
<li>Each sampler creates an instance of the test class, so write your test so the setup happens in <code>oneTimeSetUp</code> and <code>oneTimeTearDown</code>.</li>
</ul>

<dt><code>@BeforeClass</code>, <code>@AfterClass</code></dt><dd>treated as test methods so they can be run independently as required</dd>
</dl>
<note>
Note that JMeter currently runs the test methods directly, rather than leaving it to JUnit.
This is to allow the <code>setUp</code>/<code>tearDown</code> methods to be excluded from the sample time.

<description>
The Test Action sampler is a sampler that is intended for use in a conditional controller.
Rather than generate a sample, the test element either pauses or stops the selected target.
<p>This sampler can also be useful in conjunction with the Transaction Controller, as it allows
pauses to be included without needing to generate a sample. 
For variable delays, set the pause time to zero, and add a Timer as a child.</p>
<p>
The "<code>Stop</code>" action stops the thread or test after completing any samples that are in progress.
The "<code>Stop Now</code>" action stops the test without waiting for samples to complete; it will interrupt any active samples.
If some threads fail to stop within the 5 second time-limit, a message will be displayed in GUI mode.
You can try using the <code>Stop</code> command to see if this will stop the threads, but if not, you should exit JMeter.
In non-GUI mode, JMeter will exit if some threads fail to stop within the 5 second time limit.

<description>
<p>
The OS Process Sampler is a sampler that can be used to execute commands on the local machine.<br></br>
It should allow execution of any command that can be run from the command line.<br></br>
Validation of the return code can be enabled, and the expected return code can be specified.<br></br>
</p>
<p>
Note that OS shells generally provide command-line parsing. 
This varies between OSes, but generally the shell will split parameters on white-space.
Some shells expand wild-card file names; some don't.
The quoting mechanism also varies between OSes.
The sampler deliberately does not do any parsing or quote handling.
The command and its parameters must be provided in the form expected by the executable.
This means that the sampler settings will not be portable between OSes.
</p>
<p>
Many OSes have some built-in commands which are not provided as separate executables. 
For example the Windows <code>DIR</code> command is part of the command interpreter (<code>CMD.EXE</code>).
These built-ins cannot be run as independent programs, but have to be provided as arguments to the appropriate command interpreter.
</p>
<p>
For example, the Windows command-line: <code>DIR C:\TEMP</code> needs to be specified as follows:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Command:</dt><dd><code>CMD</code></dd>
<dt>Param 1:</dt><dd><code>/C</code></dd>

In this example, we created a Test Plan that has two threads that send HTTP request.
Each thread sends one request to the Home Page, followed by three requests to the Bug Page.
Although we configured the Thread Group to iterate three times, each JMeter thread only
sends one request to the Home Page because this request lives inside a Once Only Controller.</p>

<note>JMeter will expose the looping index as a variable named <code>__jm__&lt;Name of your element&gt;__idx</code>. So for
example, if your While Controller is named WC, then you can access the looping index through <code>${__jm__WC__idx}</code>.
Index starts at 0</note>
</p>

<p>Possible condition values:</p>
<ul>
<li>blank - exit loop when last sample in loop fails</li>
<li><code>LAST</code> - exit loop when last sample in loop fails.
If the last sample just before the loop failed, don't enter loop.</li>
<li>Otherwise - exit (or don't enter) the loop when the condition is equal to the string "<code>false</code>"</li>
</ul>
<note>
The condition can be any variable or function that eventually evaluates to the string "<code>false</code>".
This allows the use of <code><funclink name="__jexl3"/></code>, <code><funclink name="__groovy"/></code> function, properties or variables as needed.
</note>
<br></br>
<note>
Note that the condition is evaluated twice, once before starting sampling children and once at end of children sampling, so putting
non idempotent functions in Condition (like <code><funclink name="__counter"/></code>) can introduce issues.

run them in sequence, the controller runs the element defined by the switch value.
</p>
<note>
The switch value can also be a name.
</note>
<p>If the switch value is out of range, it will run the zeroth element,

It also runs the zeroth element if the value is the empty string.</p>

If the value is non-numeric (and non-empty), then the Switch Controller looks for the
element with the same name (case is significant).

<description><p>A ForEach controller loops through the values of a set of related variables. 
When you add samplers (or controllers) to a ForEach controller, every sample (or controller)
is executed one or more times, where during every loop the variable has a new value.
The input should consist of several variables, each extended with an underscore and a number.
Each such variable must have a value.
So for example when the input variable has the name <code>inputVar</code>, the following variables should have been defined:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>inputVar_1 = wendy</code></li>
        <li><code>inputVar_2 = charles</code></li>
        <li><code>inputVar_3 = peter</code></li>
        <li><code>inputVar_4 = john</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: the "<code>_</code>" separator is now optional.</p>
<p>
When the return variable is given as "<code>returnVar</code>", the collection of samplers and controllers under the ForEach controller will be executed <code>4</code> consecutive times,
with the return variable having the respective above values, which can then be used in the samplers.
</p>
<p><note>JMeter will expose the looping index as a variable named <code>__jm__&lt;Name of your element&gt;__idx</code>. So for
example, if your Loop Controller is named FEC, then you can access the looping index through <code>${__jm__FEC__idx}</code>.
Index starts at 0</note></p>
<p>
It is especially suited for running with the regular expression post-processor. 
This can "create" the necessary input variables out of the result data of a previous request.
By omitting the "<code>_</code>" separator, the ForEach Controller can be used to loop through the groups by using
the input variable <code>refName_g</code>, and can also loop through all the groups in all the matches
by using an input variable of the form <code>refName_${C}_g</code>, where <code>C</code> is a counter variable.
</p>
<note>The ForEach Controller does not run any samples if <code>inputVar_1</code> is <code>null</code>.
This would be the case if the Regular Expression returned no matches.</note>

<description>
<p>
The Module Controller provides a mechanism for substituting test plan fragments into the current test plan at run-time.
</p>
<p>
A test plan fragment consists of a Controller and all the test elements (samplers etc.) contained in it. 
The fragment can be located in any Thread Group.
If the fragment is located in a Thread Group, then its Controller can be disabled to prevent the fragment being run
except by the Module Controller. 
Or you can store the fragments in a dummy Thread Group, and disable the entire Thread Group. 
</p>
<p>
There can be multiple fragments, each with a different series of
samplers under them.  The module controller can then be used to easily switch between these multiple test cases simply by choosing
the appropriate controller in its drop down box.  This provides convenience for running many alternate test plans quickly and easily.
</p>
<p>
A fragment name is made up of the Controller name and all its parent names.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
Test Plan / Protocol: JDBC / Control / Interleave Controller (Module1)
</pre>
<p>
Any <b>fragments used by the Module Controller must have a unique name</b>,
as the name is used to find the target controller when a test plan is reloaded.
For this reason it is best to ensure that the Controller name is changed from the default
- as shown in the example above -
otherwise a duplicate may be accidentally created when new elements are added to the test plan.

    <description>
        <p>
        The Transaction Controller generates an additional
        sample which measures the overall time taken to perform the nested test elements.
        </p>
        <note>
        Note: when the check box "<code>Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample</code>" is checked,
        the time includes all processing within the controller scope, not just the samples.
        </note>
        <p>
        There are two modes of operation:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>additional sample is added after the nested samples</li>
        <li>additional sample is added as a parent of the nested samples</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The generated sample time includes all the times for the nested samplers excluding by default (since 2.11) timers and processing time of pre/post processors 
        unless checkbox "<code>Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample</code>" is checked.
        Depending on the clock resolution, it may be slightly longer than the sum of the individual samplers plus timers.
        The clock might tick after the controller recorded the start time but before the first sample starts.
        Similarly at the end.
        </p>
        <p>The generated sample is only regarded as successful if all its sub-samples are successful.</p>
        <p>
        In parent mode, the individual samples can still be seen in the Tree View Listener,
        but no longer appear as separate entries in other Listeners.
        Also, the sub-samples do not appear in CSV log files, but they can be saved to XML files.
        </p>
        <note>
        In parent mode, Assertions (etc.) can be added to the Transaction Controller.
        However by default they will be applied to both the individual samples and the overall transaction sample.
        To limit the scope of the Assertions, use a Simple Controller to contain the samples, and add the Assertions
        to the Simple Controller.
        Parent mode controllers do not currently properly support nested transaction controllers of either type.

<section name="&sect-num;.3 Listeners" anchor="listeners">
<description>
    <br></br>
Most of the listeners perform several roles in addition to "listening"
to the test results.  
They also provide means to view, save, and read saved test results.
<p>Note that Listeners are processed at the end of the scope in which they are found.</p>
<p>
The saving and reading of test results is generic.  The various
listeners have a panel whereby one can specify the file to
which the results will be written (or read from).
By default, the results are stored as XML
files, typically with a "<code>.jtl</code>" extension.
Storing as CSV is the most efficient option, but is less detailed than XML (the other available option).
</p>
<p>
<b>Listeners do <i>not</i> process sample data in non-GUI mode, but the raw data will be saved if an output
file has been configured.</b>
In order to analyse the data generated by a non-GUI test run, you need to load the file into the appropriate
Listener.
</p>
<note>
To read existing results and display them, use the file panel Browse button to open the file.
</note>
<p>
If you want to clear any current data before loading a new file, use the menu item
<menuchoice>
  <guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>Clear</guimenuitem>
  <shortcut>
    <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>Shift</keysym><keysym>E</keysym></keycombo>
  </shortcut>
</menuchoice>
or
<menuchoice>
  <guimenuitem>Run</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>Clear All</guimenuitem>
  <shortcut>
    <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>E</keysym></keycombo>
  </shortcut>
</menuchoice>
before loading the file.
</p>
<p>Results can be read from XML or CSV format files.
When reading from CSV results files, the header (if present) is used to determine which fields are present.
<b>In order to interpret a header-less CSV file correctly, the appropriate properties must be set in <code>jmeter.properties</code>.</b>
<note>
XML files written by JMeter have version 1.0 declared in header while actual file is serialized with 1.1 rules. 
(This is done for historical compatibility reasons; see <bugzilla>59973</bugzilla> and <bugzilla>58679</bugzilla>) 
This causes strict XML parsers to fail. Consider using non-strict XML parsers to read JTL files.
</note>
</p>
<note>
The file name can contain function and/or variable references.
However variable references do not work in client-server mode (functions work OK).
This is because the file is created on the client, and the client does not run the test locally so does not set up variables.
</note>
<p><b>Listeners can use a lot of memory if there are a lot of samples.</b>
Most of the listeners currently keep a copy of every sample in their scope, apart from:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Data Writer</li>
<li>BeanShell/JSR223 Listener</li>
<li>Mailer Visualizer</li>
<li>Summary Report</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following Listeners no longer need to keep copies of every single sample.
Instead, samples with the same elapsed time are aggregated.
Less memory is now needed, especially if most samples only take a second or two at most.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate Report</li>
<li>Aggregate Graph</li>
</ul>
<p>To minimise the amount of memory needed, use the Simple Data Writer, and use the CSV format.</p>
<note>
JMeter variables can be saved to the output files.
This can only be specified using a property.
See the <a href="listeners.html#sample_variables">Listener Sample Variables</a> for details
</note>
<p>
For full details on setting up the default items to be saved

</p>
<note>The entries in <code>jmeter.properties</code> are used to define the defaults; 
these can be overridden for individual listeners by using the Configure button,
as shown below. 
The settings in <code>jmeter.properties</code> also apply to the listener that is added

<note>
Graph Results MUST NOT BE USED during load test as it consumes a lot of resources (memory and CPU). Use it only for either functional testing or

</note>
<p>The Graph Results listener generates a simple graph that plots all sample times.  Along
the bottom of the graph, the current sample (black), the current average of all samples (blue), the
current standard deviation (red), and the current throughput rate (green) are displayed in milliseconds.</p>
<p>The throughput number represents the actual number of requests/minute the server handled.  This calculation
includes any delays you added to your test and JMeter's own internal processing time.  The advantage
of doing the calculation like this is that this number represents something
real - your server in fact handled that many requests per minute, and you can increase the number of threads
and/or decrease the delays to discover your server's maximum throughput.  Whereas if you made calculations
that factored out delays and JMeter's processing, it would be unclear what you could conclude from that
number.</p></description>
<p>The following table briefly describes the items on the graph.

Note that the Request panel only shows the headers added by JMeter.
It does not show any headers (such as <code>Host</code>) that may be added by the HTTP protocol implementation.
<p>
There are several ways to view the response, selectable by a drop-down box at the bottom of the left hand panel.</p>

<table>
<tr><th><b>Renderer</b></th><th><b>Description</b></th></tr>
<tr><td><code>CSS/JQuery Tester</code></td>
<td>The <i>CSS/JQuery Tester</i> only works for text responses. It shows the plain text in the upper panel.
The "<code>Test</code>" button allows the user to apply the CSS/JQuery to the upper panel and the results
will be displayed in the lower panel.<br/>
The CSS/JQuery expression engine can be JSoup or Jodd, syntax of these 2 implementation differs slightly.<br/>
For example, the Selector <code>a[class=sectionlink]</code> with attribute <code>href</code> applied to the current JMeter functions page gives the following output:
<br/>

Match[8]=#__regexFunction_parms
Match[9]=#__counter
&hellip; and so on &hellip;
</source>
<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Document</code></td>
<td>The <i>Document view</i> will show the extract text from various type of documents like Microsoft Office
(Word, Excel, PowerPoint 97-2003, 2007-2010 (openxml), Apache OpenOffice (writer, calc, impress), HTML,
gzip, jar/zip files (list of content), and some meta-data on "multimedia" files like mp3, mp4, flv, etc. The complete list of 
support format is available on <a href="http://tika.apache.org/1.2/formats.html">Apache Tika format page.</a>
<note>A requirement to the <code>Document view</code> is to download the <a href="http://tika.apache.org/download.html">
Apache Tika binary package</a> (<code>tika-app-x.x.jar</code>) and put this in <code>JMETER_HOME/lib</code> directory.
</note>
If the document is larger than 10 MB, then it won't be displayed.
To change this limit, set the JMeter property <code>document.max_size</code> (unit is byte) or set to <code>0</code> to remove the limit.
<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>HTML</code></td>
<td>The <i>HTML view</i> attempts to render the response as
HTML.  The rendered HTML is likely to compare poorly to the view one
would get in any web browser; however, it does provide a quick
approximation that is helpful for initial result evaluation.<br/>
Images, style-sheets, etc. aren't downloaded. 
<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>HTML (download resources)</code></td>
<td>If the <i>HTML (download resources) view</i> option is selected, the renderer
may download images, style-sheets, etc. referenced by the HTML code. 
<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>HTML Source formatted</code></td>
<td>If the <em>HTML Source formatted view</em> option is selected, the renderer will display the HTML source code formatted and cleaned by <a href="https://jsoup.org/">Jsoup</a>. 
<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>JSON</code></td>
<td>The <i>JSON view</i> will show the response in tree style (also handles JSON embedded in JavaScript).

<tr><td><code>JSON Path Tester</code></td>
<td>The <i>JSON Path Tester view</i> will let you test your JSON-PATH expressions and see the extracted data from a particular response.
<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Regexp Tester</code></td>
<td>The <i>Regexp Tester view</i> only works for text responses. It shows the plain text in the upper panel.
The "<code>Test</code>" button allows the user to apply the Regular Expression to the upper panel and the results
will be displayed in the lower panel.<br/>
The regular expression engine is the same as that used in the Regular Expression Extractor.<br/>
For example, the RE <code>(JMeter\w*).*</code> applied to the current JMeter home page gives the following output:
<br/>

Match[3][1]=JMeterCommitters
&hellip; and so on &hellip;
</source>
<br/>
The first number in <code>[]</code> is the match number; the second number is the group. 
Group <code>[0]</code> is whatever matched the whole RE.
Group <code>[1]</code> is whatever matched the 1<sup>st</sup> group, i.e. <code>(JMeter\w*)</code> in this case.
See Figure 9b (below).

You can use <complink name="Save Responses to a file"/> to save the data in this case.
Note that the response data will still be available in the sample result,
so can still be accessed using Post-Processors.
</p>
<p>If the response data is larger than 200K, then it won't be displayed.
To change this limit, set the JMeter property <code>view.results.tree.max_size</code>.

<component name="Aggregate Report" index="&sect-num;.3.7"  width="1206" height="306" screenshot="aggregate_report.png">
<description>The aggregate report creates a table row for each differently named request in your
test.  For each request, it totals the response information and provides request count, min, max,
average, error rate, approximate throughput (request/second) and Kilobytes per second throughput.
Once the test is done, the throughput is the actual through for the duration of the entire test.
<p>
The throughput is calculated from the point of view of the sampler target 
(e.g. the remote server in the case of HTTP samples).
JMeter takes into account the total time over which the requests have been generated.
If other samplers and timers are in the same thread, these will increase the total time,
and therefore reduce the throughput value. 
So two identical samplers with different names will have half the throughput of two samplers with the same name.
It is important to choose the sampler names correctly to get the best results from
the Aggregate Report.
</p>
<p>
Calculation of the <a href="glossary.html#Median">Median</a> and 90% Line (90<sup>th</sup> <a href="glossary.html#Percentile">percentile</a>) values requires additional memory.
JMeter now combines samples with the same elapsed time, so far less memory is used.
However, for samples that take more than a few seconds, the probability is that fewer samples will have identical times,
in which case more memory will be needed.
Note you can use this listener afterwards to reload a CSV or XML results file which is the recommended way to avoid performance impacts.
See the <complink name="Summary Report"/> for a similar Listener that does not store individual samples and so needs constant memory.
</p>
<note>
Starting with JMeter 2.12, you can configure the 3 percentile values you want to compute, this can be done by setting properties:
<ul>
    <li><code>aggregate_rpt_pct1</code>: defaults to 90<sup>th</sup> <a href="glossary.html#Percentile">percentile</a></li>
    <li><code>aggregate_rpt_pct2</code>: defaults to 95<sup>th</sup> <a href="glossary.html#Percentile">percentile</a></li>
    <li><code>aggregate_rpt_pct3</code>: defaults to 99<sup>th</sup> <a href="glossary.html#Percentile">percentile</a></li>
</ul>
</note>
<ul>
<li><code>Label</code> - The label of the sample.
If "<code>Include group name in label?</code>" is selected, then the name of the thread group is added as a prefix.
This allows identical labels from different thread groups to be collated separately if required.
</li>
<li><code># Samples</code> - The number of samples with the same label</li>
<li><code>Average</code> - The average time of a set of results</li>
<li><code>Median</code> - The <a href="glossary.html#Median">median</a> is the time in the middle of a set of results.

<li><code>99% Line</code> - 99% of the samples took no more than this time.

<li><code>Error %</code> - Percent of requests with errors</li>
<li><code>Throughput</code> - the <a href="glossary.html#Throughput">Throughput</a> is measured in requests per second/minute/hour.
The time unit is chosen so that the displayed rate is at least 1.0.
When the throughput is saved to a CSV file, it is expressed in requests/second,

<description>This visualizer creates a row for every sample result.  
Like the <complink name="View Results Tree"/>, this visualizer uses a lot of memory.
<p>
By default, it only displays the main (parent) samples; it does not display the sub-samples (child samples).
JMeter has a "<code>Child Samples?</code>" check-box.
If this is selected, then the sub-samples are displayed instead of the main samples.

<component name="Summary Report" index="&sect-num;.3.16"  width="1204" height="300" screenshot="summary_report.png">
<description>The summary report creates a table row for each differently named request in your
test. This is similar to the <complink name="Aggregate Report"/> , except that it uses less memory.
<p>
The throughput is calculated from the point of view of the sampler target 
(e.g. the remote server in the case of HTTP samples).
JMeter takes into account the total time over which the requests have been generated.
If other samplers and timers are in the same thread, these will increase the total time,
and therefore reduce the throughput value. 
So two identical samplers with different names will have half the throughput of two samplers with the same name.
It is important to choose the sampler labels correctly to get the best results from
the Report.
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Label</code> - The label of the sample.
If "<code>Include group name in label?</code>" is selected, then the name of the thread group is added as a prefix.
This allows identical labels from different thread groups to be collated separately if required.
</li>
<li><code># Samples</code> - The number of samples with the same label</li>
<li><code>Average</code> - The average elapsed time of a set of results</li>
<li><code>Min</code> - The lowest elapsed time for the samples with the same label</li>
<li><code>Max</code> - The longest elapsed time for the samples with the same label</li>
<li><code>Std. Dev.</code> - the <a href="glossary.html#StandardDeviation">Standard Deviation</a> of the sample elapsed time</li>
<li><code>Error %</code> - Percent of requests with errors</li>
<li><code>Throughput</code> - the <a href="glossary.html#Throughput">Throughput</a> is measured in requests per second/minute/hour.
The time unit is chosen so that the displayed rate is at least <code>1.0</code>.
When the throughput is saved to a CSV file, it is expressed in requests/second,
i.e. 30.0 requests/minute is saved as <code>0.5</code>.
</li>
<li><code>Received KB/sec</code> - The throughput measured in Kilobytes per second</li>
<li><code>Sent KB/sec</code> - The throughput measured in Kilobytes per second</li>

    <description>
        <p>
        This test element can be placed anywhere in the test plan.
        For each sample in its scope, it will create a file of the response Data.
        The primary use for this is in creating functional tests, but it can also
        be useful where the response is too large to be displayed in the 
        <complink name="View Results Tree"/> Listener.
        The file name is created from the specified prefix, plus a number (unless this is disabled, see below).
        The file extension is created from the document type, if known.
        If not known, the file extension is set to '<code>unknown</code>'.
        If numbering is disabled, and adding a suffix is disabled, then the file prefix is
        taken as the entire file name. This allows a fixed file name to be generated if required.
        The generated file name is stored in the sample response, and can be saved
        in the test log output file if required.
        </p>
        <p>
        The current sample is saved first, followed by any sub-samples (child samples).
        If a variable name is provided, then the names of the files are saved in the order
        that the sub-samples appear. See below.

        JMeter also supports paths relative to the directory containing the current test plan (JMX file).
        If the path name begins with "<code>~/</code>" (or whatever is in the <code>jmeter.save.saveservice.base_prefix</code> JMeter property),
        then the path is assumed to be relative to the JMX file location. <br/>
        If parent folders in prefix do not exists, JMeter will create them and stop test if it fails.
        <note>Please note that Filename Prefix must not contain Thread related data, so don't use any Variable (<code>${varName}</code>) or functions like <code>${__threadNum}</code> in this field</note>
 </property>
 <property name="Variable Name containing saved file name" required="No">
 Name of a variable in which to save the generated file name (so it can be used later in the test plan).
 If there are sub-samples then a numeric suffix is added to the variable name.
 E.g. if the variable name is <code>FILENAME</code>, then the parent sample file name is saved in the variable <code>FILENAME</code>, 
 and the filenames for the child samplers are saved in <code>FILENAME1</code>, <code>FILENAME2</code> etc.
 </property>
 <property name="Minimum Length of sequence number" required="No">If "<code>Don't add number to prefix</code>" is not checked, then numbers added to prefix will be padded by <code>0</code> so that prefix is has size of this value. Defaults to <code>0</code>.</property>

The "<code>label</code>" is the name of the element.
The <code>"+"</code> means that the line is a delta line, i.e. shows the changes since the last output.<br/>
The <code>"="</code> means that the line is a total line, i.e. it shows the running total.<br/>
Entries in the JMeter log file also include time-stamps.
The example "<code>817 in 0:05:07 =    2.7/s</code>" means that there were 817 samples recorded in 5 minutes and 7 seconds,
and that works out at 2.7 samples per second.<br/>
The <code>Avg</code> (Average), <code>Min</code> (Minimum) and <code>Max</code> (Maximum) times are in milliseconds.<br/>
"<code>Err</code>" means number of errors (also shown as percentage).<br/>
The last two lines will appear at the end of a test.
They will not be synchronised to the appropriate time boundary.
Note that the initial and final deltas may be for less than the interval (in the example above this is 30 seconds).
The first delta will generally be lower, as JMeter synchronizes to the interval boundary.
The last delta will be lower, as the test will generally not finish on an exact interval boundary.
<p>
The label is used to group sample results together. 
So if you have multiple Thread Groups and want to summarize across them all, then use the same label
 - or add the summariser to the Test Plan (so all thread groups are in scope).
Different summary groupings can be implemented
by using suitable labels and adding the summarisers to appropriate parts of the test plan.
</p>
<note>
In Non-GUI mode by default a Generate Summary Results listener named "<code>summariser</code>" is configured, if you have already added one to your Test Plan, ensure you name it differently 
otherwise results will be accumulated under this label (summary) leading to wrong results (sum of total samples + samples located under the Parent of Generate Summary Results listener).<br/>
This is not a bug but a design choice allowing to summarize across thread groups.

    Configuration elements can be used to set up defaults and variables for later use by samplers.

<component name="CSV Data Set Config" index="&sect-num;.4.1"  width="433" height="281" screenshot="csvdatasetconfig.png">
<description>
    <p>
    CSV Data Set Config is used to read lines from a file, and split them into variables.
    It is easier to use than the <code><funclink name="__CSVRead()"/></code> and <code><funclink name="__StringFromFile()"/></code> functions.
    It is well suited to handling large numbers of variables, and is also useful for testing with
    "random" and unique values.</p>
    <p>Generating unique random values at run-time is expensive in terms of CPU and memory, so just create the data
    in advance of the test. If necessary, the "random" data from the file can be used in conjunction with
    a run-time parameter to create different sets of values from each run - e.g. using concatenation - which is
    much cheaper than generating everything at run-time.
    </p>
    <p>
    JMeter allows values to be quoted; this allows the value to contain a delimiter.
    If "<code>allow quoted data</code>" is enabled, a value may be enclosed in double-quotes.
    These are removed. To include double-quotes within a quoted field, use two double-quotes.
    For example:
    </p>
<source>
1,"2,3","4""5" =>
1
2,3
4"5
</source>
    <p>
    JMeter supports CSV files which have a header line defining the column names.
    To enable this, leave the "<code>Variable Names</code>" field empty. The correct delimiter must be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
    JMeter supports CSV files with quoted data that includes new-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
    By default, the file is only opened once, and each thread will use a different line from the file.
    However the order in which lines are passed to threads depends on the order in which they execute,
    which may vary between iterations.
    Lines are read at the start of each test iteration.
    The file name and mode are resolved in the first iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
    See the description of the Share mode below for additional options.
    If you want each thread to have its own set of values, then you will need to create a set of files,
    one for each thread. For example <code>test1.csv</code>, <code>test2.csv</code>, &hellip;, <code>test<em>n</em>.csv</code>. Use the filename 
    <code>test${__threadNum}.csv</code> and set the "<code>Sharing mode</code>" to "<code>Current thread</code>".
    </p>
    <note>CSV Dataset variables are defined at the start of each test iteration.
    As this is after configuration processing is completed,
    they cannot be used for some configuration items - such as JDBC Config - 
    that process their contents at configuration time (see <bugzilla>40394</bugzilla>)
    However the variables do work in the HTTP Auth Manager, as the <code>username</code> etc. are processed at run-time.
    </note>
    <p>
    As a special case, the string "<code>\t</code>" (without quotes) in the delimiter field is treated as a Tab.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the end of file (<code><abbr title="end of file">EOF</abbr></code>) is reached, and the recycle option is <code>true</code>, reading starts again with the first line of the file.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the recycle option is <code>false</code>, and stopThread is <code>false</code>, then all the variables are set to <code>&lt;EOF&gt;</code> when the end of file is reached.
    This value can be changed by setting the JMeter property <code>csvdataset.eofstring</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the Recycle option is <code>false</code>, and Stop Thread is <code>true</code>, then reaching <code><abbr title="end of file">EOF</abbr></code> will cause the thread to be stopped.

  <b>Relative file names are resolved with respect to the path of the active test plan.</b>
  <b>For distributed testing, the CSV file must be stored on the server host system in the correct relative directory to where the JMeter server is started.</b>
  Absolute file names are also supported, but note that they are unlikely to work in remote mode, 
  unless the remote server has the same directory structure.
  If the same physical file is referenced in two different ways - e.g. <code>csvdata.txt</code> and <code>./csvdata.txt</code> -
  then these are treated as different files.
  If the OS does not distinguish between upper and lower case, <code>csvData.TXT</code> would also be opened separately. 
  </property>
  <property name="File Encoding" required="No">The encoding to be used to read the file, if not the platform default.</property>
  <property name="Variable Names" required="No">List of variable names. The names must be separated by the delimiter character. They can be quoted using double-quotes.
  JMeter supports CSV header lines:
  if the variable name field empty, then the first line of the file is read and interpreted as the list of column names.
  </property>
  <property name="Use first line as Variable Names" required="No">
  Ignore first line of CSV file, it will only be used used if Variable Names is not empty, 
  if Variable Names is empty the first line must contain the headers.
  </property>
  <property name="Delimiter" required="Yes">Delimiter to be used to split the records in the file.
  If there are fewer values on the line than there are variables the remaining variables are not updated -

  <property name="Allow quoted data?" required="Yes">Should the CSV file allow values to be quoted?
  If enabled, then values can be enclosed in <code>"</code> - double-quote - allowing values to contain a delimiter.
  </property>
  <property name="Recycle on EOF?" required="Yes">Should the file be re-read from the beginning on reaching <code><abbr title="end of file">EOF</abbr></code>? (default is <code>true</code>)</property>
  <property name="Stop thread on EOF?" required="Yes">Should the thread be stopped on <code><abbr title="end of file">EOF</abbr></code>, if Recycle is false? (default is <code>false</code>)</property>
  <property name="Sharing mode" required="Yes">
  <ul>
  <li><code>All threads</code> - (the default) the file is shared between all the threads.</li>
  <li><code>Current thread group</code> - each file is opened once for each thread group in which the element appears</li>
  <li><code>Current thread</code> - each file is opened separately for each thread</li>
  <li><code>Identifier</code> - all threads sharing the same identifier share the same file.
  So for example if you have 4 thread groups, you could use a common id for two or more of the groups
  to share the file between them.
  Or you could use the thread number to share the file between the same thread numbers in different thread groups.

    <note>DNS Cache Manager is designed for using in the root of Thread Group or Test Plan. Do not place it as child element of particular HTTP Sampler
    </note>
    <note>DNS Cache Manager works only with HTTP requests using HTTPClient4 implementation.</note>
    <description><p>The DNS Cache Manager element allows to test applications, which have several servers behind load balancers (CDN, etc.), 
    when user receives content from different IP's. By default JMeter uses JVM DNS cache. That's why
    only one server from the cluster receives load. DNS Cache Manager resolves names for each thread separately each iteration and
    saves results of resolving to its internal DNS Cache, which is independent from both JVM and OS DNS caches.
    </p>
    <p>
    A mapping for static hosts can be used to simulate something like <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.
    These entries will be preferred over the custom resolver. <code>Use custom DNS resolver</code> has to be enabled,
    if you want to use this mapping.
    </p>
    <example title="Usage of static host table" anchor="static_host_table">
    <p>Say, you have a test server, that you want to reach with a name, that is not (yet) set up in your DNS servers.
    For our example, this would be <code>www.example.com</code> for the server name, which you want to reach at the
    IP of the server <code>a123.another.example.org</code>.
    </p>
    <p>You could change your workstation and add an entry to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file - or the equivalent for
    your OS, or add an entry to the Static Host Table of the DNS Cache Manager.
    </p>
    <p>You would type <code>www.example.com</code> into the first column (<code>Host</code>) and
    <code>a123.another.example.org</code> into the second column (<code>Hostname or IP address</code>).
    As the name of the second column implies, you could even use the IP address of your test server there.
    </p>
    <p>The IP address for the test server will be looked up by using the custom DNS resolver. When none is given, the
    system DNS resolver will be used.
    </p>
    <p>Now you can use <code>www.example.com</code> in your HTTPClient4 samplers and the requests will be made against
    <code>a123.another.example.org</code> with all headers set to <code>www.example.com</code>.

<component name="HTTP Authorization Manager" index="&sect-num;.4.4"  width="538" height="340" screenshot="http-config/http-auth-manager.png">
<note>If there is more than one Authorization Manager in the scope of a Sampler,
there is currently no way to specify which one is to be used.</note>

<description>
<p>The Authorization Manager lets you specify one or more user logins for web pages that are
restricted using server authentication.  You see this type of authentication when you use
your browser to access a restricted page, and your browser displays a login dialog box.  JMeter
transmits the login information when it encounters this type of page.</p>
<p>
The Authorization headers may not be shown in the Tree View Listener "<code>Request</code>" tab.
The Java implementation does pre-emptive authentication, but it does not
return the Authorization header when JMeter fetches the headers.
The HttpComponents (HC 4.5.X) implementation defaults to pre-emptive since 3.2 and the header will be shown.
To disable this, set the values as below, in which case authentication will only be performed in response to a challenge.
</p>
<p>
In the file <code>jmeter.properties</code> set <code>httpclient4.auth.preemptive=false</code>
</p>
<note>
Note: the above settings only apply to the HttpClient sampler.
</note>
<note>
When looking for a match against a URL, JMeter checks each entry in turn, and stops when it finds the first match.
Thus the most specific URLs should appear first in the list, followed by less specific ones.
Duplicate URLs will be ignored.
If you want to use different usernames/passwords for different threads, you can use variables.
These can be set up using a <complink name="CSV Data Set Config"/> Element (for example).

<br></br>
<b>Kerberos Configuration:</b>
<p>To configure Kerberos you need to setup at least two JVM system properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>-Djava.security.krb5.conf=krb5.conf</code></li>
    <li><code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
You can also configure those two properties in the file <code>bin/system.properties</code>.
Look at the two sample configuration files (<code>krb5.conf</code> and <code>jaas.conf</code>) located in the JMeter <code>bin</code> folder
for references to more documentation, and tweak them to match your Kerberos configuration.
</p>
<p>
Delegation of credentials is disabled by default for SPNEGO. If you want to enable it, you can do so by setting the property <code>kerberos.spnego.delegate_cred</code> to <code>true</code>.
</p>
<p>
When generating a SPN for Kerberos SPNEGO authentication IE and Firefox will omit the port number
from the URL. Chrome has an option (<code>--enable-auth-negotiate-port</code>) to include the port
number if it differs from the standard ones (<code>80</code> and <code>443</code>). That behavior
can be emulated by setting the following JMeter property as below.
</p>
<p>
In <code>jmeter.properties</code> or <code>user.properties</code>, set:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kerberos.spnego.strip_port=false</code></li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<b>Controls:</b>
<ul>
  <li><code>Add</code> Button - Add an entry to the authorization table.</li>
  <li><code>Delete</code> Button - Delete the currently selected table entry.</li>
  <li><code>Load</code> Button - Load a previously saved authorization table and add the entries to the existing
authorization table entries.</li>
  <li><code>Save As</code> Button - Save the current authorization table to a file.</li>
</ul>

<note>When you save the Test Plan, JMeter automatically saves all of the authorization
table entries - including any passwords, which are not encrypted.</note>

<example title="Authorization Example" anchor="authorization_example">

<p><a href="../demos/AuthManagerTestPlan.jmx">Download</a> this example.  In this example, we created a Test Plan on a local server that sends three HTTP requests, two requiring a login and the
other is open to everyone.  See figure 10 to see the makeup of our Test Plan.  On our server, we have a restricted
directory named, "<code>secret</code>", which contains two files, "<code>index.html</code>" and "<code>index2.html</code>".  We created a login id named, "<code>kevin</code>",
which has a password of "<code>spot</code>".  So, in our Authorization Manager, we created an entry for the restricted directory and
a username and password (see figure 11).  The two HTTP requests named "<code>SecretPage1</code>" and "<code>SecretPage2</code>" make requests
to "<code>/secret/index.html</code>" and "<code>/secret/index2.html</code>".  The other HTTP request, named "<code>NoSecretPage</code>" makes a request to
"<code>/index.html</code>".</p>

<figure width="641" height="329" image="http-config/auth-manager-example1b.png">Figure 11 - Authorization Manager Control Panel</figure>

<p>When we run the Test Plan, JMeter looks in the Authorization table for the URL it is requesting.  If the Base URL matches
the URL, then JMeter passes this information along with the request.</p>

<note>You can download the Test Plan, but since it is built as a test for our local server, you will not

<component name="HTTP Cache Manager" index="&sect-num;.4.5"  width="511" height="196" screenshot="http-config/http-cache-manager.png">
<description>
<p>
The HTTP Cache Manager is used to add caching functionality to HTTP requests within its scope to simulate browser cache feature.
Each Virtual User thread has its own Cache. By default, Cache Manager will store up to 5000 items in cache per Virtual User thread, using LRU algorithm. 
Use property "<code>maxSize</code>" to modify this value. Note that the more you increase this value the more HTTP Cache Manager will consume memory, so be sure to adapt the <code>-Xmx</code> JVM option accordingly.
</p>
<p>
If a sample is successful (i.e. has response code <code>2xx</code>) then the <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>Etag</code> (and <code>Expired</code> if relevant) values are saved for the URL.
Before executing the next sample, the sampler checks to see if there is an entry in the cache, 
and if so, the <code>If-Last-Modified</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> conditional headers are set for the request.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, if the "<code>Use Cache-Control/Expires header</code>" option is selected, then the <code>Cache-Control</code>/<code>Expires</code> value is checked against the current time.
If the request is a <code>GET</code> request, and the timestamp is in the future, then the sampler returns immediately,
without requesting the URL from the remote server. This is intended to emulate browser behaviour.
Note that if <code>Cache-Control</code> header is "<code>no-cache</code>", the response will be stored in cache as pre-expired,
so will generate a conditional <code>GET</code> request.
If <code>Cache-Control</code> has any other value, 
the "<code>max-age</code>" expiry option is processed to compute entry lifetime, if missing then expire header will be used, if also missing entry will be cached 
as specified in <rfc link="2616#section-13.2.4">RFC 2616 section 13.2.4</rfc> using <code>Last-Modified</code> time and response Date.
</p>
<note>
If the requested document has not changed since it was cached, then the response body will be empty.
Likewise if the <code>Expires</code> date is in the future.
This may cause problems for Assertions.

<component name="HTTP Cookie Manager" index="&sect-num;.4.6"  width="653" height="373" screenshot="http-config/http-cookie-manager.png">

<note>If there is more than one Cookie Manager in the scope of a Sampler,
there is currently no way to specify which one is to be used.
Also, a cookie stored in one cookie manager is not available to any other manager,
so use multiple Cookie Managers with care.</note>

<description><p>The Cookie Manager element has two functions:<br></br>
First, it stores and sends cookies just like a web browser. If you have an HTTP Request and
the response contains a cookie, the Cookie Manager automatically stores that cookie and will
use it for all future requests to that particular web site.  Each JMeter thread has its own
"cookie storage area".  So, if you are testing a web site that uses a cookie for storing
session information, each JMeter thread will have its own session.
Note that such cookies do not appear on the Cookie Manager display, but they can be seen using
the <complink name="View Results Tree"/> Listener.
</p>
<p>
JMeter checks that received cookies are valid for the URL.
This means that cross-domain cookies are not stored.
If you have bugged behaviour or want Cross-Domain cookies to be used, define the JMeter property "<code>CookieManager.check.cookies=false</code>".
</p>
<p>
Received Cookies can be stored as JMeter thread variables.
To save cookies as variables, define the property "<code>CookieManager.save.cookies=true</code>".
Also, cookies names are prefixed with "<code>COOKIE_</code>" before they are stored (this avoids accidental corruption of local variables)
To revert to the original behaviour, define the property "<code>CookieManager.name.prefix= </code>" (one or more spaces).
If enabled, the value of a cookie with the name <code>TEST</code> can be referred to as <code>${COOKIE_TEST}</code>.
</p>
<p>Second, you can manually add a cookie to the Cookie Manager.  However, if you do this,
the cookie will be shared by all JMeter threads.</p>
<p>Note that such Cookies are created with an Expiration time far in the future</p>
<p>
Cookies with <code>null</code> values are ignored by default.
This can be changed by setting the JMeter property: <code>CookieManager.delete_null_cookies=false</code>.
Note that this also applies to manually defined cookies - any such cookies will be removed from the display when it is updated.
Note also that the cookie name must be unique - if a second cookie is defined with the same name, it will replace the first.

<description><p>This element lets you set default values that your HTTP Request controllers use.  For example, if you are

you could add a single HTTP Request Defaults element with the "<code>Server Name or IP</code>" field filled in.  Then, when
you add the 25 HTTP Request controllers, leave the "<code>Server Name or IP</code>" field empty.  The controllers will inherit
this field value from the HTTP Request Defaults element.</p>

All port values are treated equally; a sampler that does not specify a port will use the HTTP Request Defaults port, if one is provided.

</properties>
<note>
Note: radio buttons only have two states - on or off.
This makes it impossible to override settings consistently
- does off mean off, or does it mean use the current default?
JMeter uses the latter (otherwise defaults would not work at all).
So if the button is off, then a later element can set it on,
but if the button is on, a later element cannot set it off.

If JMeter reports <code>No suitable driver</code>, then this could mean either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The driver class was not found. In this case, there will be a log message such as <code>DataSourceElement: Could not load driver: {classname} java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: {classname}</code></li>
<li>The driver class was found, but the class does not support the connection string. This could be because of a syntax error in the connection string, or because the wrong classname was used.</li>

<ol>
<li>Create your certificates either with Java <code>keytool</code> utility or through your PKI</li>
<li>If created by PKI, import your keys in Java Key Store by converting them to a format acceptable by JKS</li>

<component name="User Defined Variables" index="&sect-num;.4.16"  width="741" height="266" screenshot="user_defined_variables.png">
<description><p>The User Defined Variables element lets you define an <b>initial set of variables</b>, just as in the <complink name="Test Plan" />.
<note>
Note that all the UDV elements in a test plan - no matter where they are - are processed at the start.
</note>
So you cannot reference variables which are defined as part of a test run, e.g. in a Post-Processor.
</p>
<p>
<b>
UDVs should not be used with functions that generate different results each time they are called.
Only the result of the first function call will be saved in the variable. 
</b>
However, UDVs can be used with functions such as <code><funclink name="__P()"/></code>, for example:
</p>
<source>
HOST      ${__P(host,localhost)} 
</source>
<p>
which would define the variable "<code>HOST</code>" to have the value of the JMeter property "<code>host</code>", defaulting to "<code>localhost</code>" if not defined.
</p>
<p>
For defining variables during a test run, see <complink name="User Parameters"/>.
UDVs are processed in the order they appear in the Plan, from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>
For simplicity, it is suggested that UDVs are placed only at the start of a Thread Group
(or perhaps under the Test Plan itself).
</p>
<p>
Once the Test Plan and all UDVs have been processed, the resulting set of variables is
copied to each thread to provide the initial set of variables.
</p>
<p>
If a runtime element such as a User Parameters Pre-Processor or Regular Expression Extractor defines a variable
with the same name as one of the UDV variables, then this will replace the initial value, and all other test
elements in the thread will see the updated value.
</p>
</description>
<note>
If you have more than one Thread Group, make sure you use different names for different values, as UDVs are shared between Thread Groups.
Also, the variables are not available for use until after the element has been processed, 
so you cannot reference variables that are defined in the same element.
You can reference variables defined in earlier UDVs or on the Test Plan.

<description>
<p>
The Random Variable Config Element is used to generate random numeric strings and store them in variable for use later.
It's simpler than using <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> together with the <code><funclink name="__Random()"/></code> function.
</p>
<p>
The output variable is constructed by using the random number generator,
and then the resulting number is formatted using the format string.
The number is calculated using the formula <code>minimum+Random.nextInt(maximum-minimum+1)</code>.
<code>Random.nextInt()</code> requires a positive integer.
This means that <code>maximum-minimum</code> - i.e. the range - must be less than <code>2147483647</code>,
however the <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> values can be any <code>long</code> values so long as the range is OK.
</p>
<note>As the random value is evaluated at the start of each iteration, it is probably not a good idea
to use a variable other than a property as a value for the minimum or maximum. It would be zero on the first iteration.</note>

<section name="&sect-num;.5 Assertions" anchor="assertions">
<description>
    <p>
    Assertions are used to perform additional checks on samplers, and are processed after <b>every sampler</b>
    in the same scope.
    To ensure that an Assertion is applied only to a particular sampler, add it as a child of the sampler.
    </p>
    <note>
    Note: Unless documented otherwise, Assertions are not applied to sub-samples (child samples) -
    only to the parent sample.
    In the case of JSR223 and BeanShell Assertions, the script can retrieve sub-samples using the method
    <code>prev.getSubResults()</code> which returns an array of SampleResults.
    The array will be empty if there are none.
    </note>
    <p>
    Assertions can be applied to either the main sample, the sub-samples or both. 
    The default is to apply the assertion to the main sample only.
    If the Assertion supports this option, then there will be an entry on the GUI which looks like the following:
    </p>
    <figure width="658" height="54" image="assertion/assertionscope.png">Assertion Scope</figure>
    or the following
    <figure width="841" height="55" image="assertion/assertionscopevar.png">Assertion Scope</figure>
    <p>
    If a sub-sampler fails and the main sample is successful,
    then the main sample will be set to failed status and an Assertion Result will be added.
    If the JMeter variable option is used, it is assumed to relate to the main sample, and
    any failure will be applied to the main sample only.
    </p>
    <note>
    The variable <code>JMeterThread.last_sample_ok</code> is updated to
    "<code>true</code>" or "<code>false</code>" after all assertions for a sampler have been run.

<component name="Response Assertion" index="&sect-num;.5.1" anchor="basic_assertion"  width="909" height="607" screenshot="assertion/assertion.png">

<description><p>The response assertion control panel lets you add pattern strings to be compared against various
    fields of the request or response.
    The pattern strings are:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>Contains</code>, <code>Matches</code>: Perl5-style regular expressions</li>
    <li><code>Equals</code>, <code>Substring</code>: plain text, case-sensitive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    A summary of the pattern matching characters can be found at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/org/apache/oro/text/regex/package-summary.html">ORO Perl5 regular expressions.</a>
    </p>
    <p>You can also choose whether the strings will be expected
to <b>match</b> the entire response, or if the response is only expected to <b>contain</b> the
pattern. You can attach multiple assertions to any controller for additional flexibility.</p>
<p>Note that the pattern string should not include the enclosing delimiters, 
    i.e. use <code>Price: \d+</code> not <code>/Price: \d+/</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    By default, the pattern is in multi-line mode, which means that the "<code>.</code>" meta-character does not match newline.
    In multi-line mode, "<code>^</code>" and "<code>$</code>" match the start or end of any line anywhere within the string 
    - not just the start and end of the entire string. Note that <code>\s</code> does match new-line.
    Case is also significant. To override these settings, one can use the <i>extended regular expression</i> syntax.
    For example:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>(?i)</code></dt><dd>ignore case</dd>
<dt><code>(?s)</code></dt><dd>treat target as single line, i.e. "<code>.</code>" matches new-line</dd>
<dt><code>(?is)</code></dt><dd>both the above</dd>
</dl>
These can be used anywhere within the expression and remain in effect until overridden. E.g.
<dl>
<dt><code>(?i)apple(?-i) Pie</code></dt><dd>matches "<code>ApPLe Pie</code>", but not "<code>ApPLe pIe</code>"</dd>
<dt><code>(?s)Apple.+?Pie</code></dt><dd>matches <code>Apple</code> followed by <code>Pie</code>, which may be on a subsequent line.</dd>
<dt><code>Apple(?s).+?Pie</code></dt><dd>same as above, but it's probably clearer to use the <code>(?s)</code> at the start.</dd>
</dl>

        <property name="Pattern Matching Rules" required="Yes">Indicates how the text being tested
        is checked against the pattern.
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <code>Equals</code> and <code>Substring</code> patterns are plain strings, not regular expressions.
        <code>NOT</code> may also be selected to invert the result of the check.
        <code>OR</code> Apply each assertion in OR combination (if 1 pattern to test matches, Assertion will be ok) instead of AND (All patterns must match so that Assertion is OK).</property>

        If a pattern fails, then further patterns are not checked.
        There is no difference between setting up
        one Assertion with multiple patterns and setting up multiple Assertions with one
        pattern each (assuming the other options are the same).
        <note>However, when the <code>Ignore Status</code> checkbox is selected, this has the effect of cancelling any
        previous assertion failures - so make sure that the <code>Ignore Status</code> checkbox is only used on
        the first Assertion.</note>

<description><p>The BeanShell Assertion allows the user to perform assertion checking using a BeanShell script.
</p>
<p>
<b>For full details on using BeanShell, please see the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell website.</a></b>
</p><p>
Note that a different Interpreter is used for each independent occurrence of the assertion
in each thread in a test script, but the same Interpreter is used for subsequent invocations.
This means that variables persist across calls to the assertion.
</p>
<p>
All Assertions are called from the same thread as the sampler.
</p>
<p>
If the property "<code>beanshell.assertion.init</code>" is defined, it is passed to the Interpreter
as the name of a sourced file. This can be used to define common methods and variables.
There is a sample init file in the <code>bin</code> directory: <code>BeanShellAssertion.bshrc</code>
</p>
<p>
The test element supports the <code>ThreadListener</code> and <code>TestListener</code> methods.
These should be defined in the initialisation file.
See the file <code>BeanShellListeners.bshrc</code> for example definitions.

<description>
    <note>
    Since version 3.1, a new feature (in Beta mode as of JMeter 3.1 and subject to changes) has been implemented which provides the following feature.<br/>
    You can apply a multiplication factor on the sleep delays computed by Random timer by setting property <code>timer.factor=float number</code> where float number is a decimal positive number.<br/>
    JMeter will multiply this factor by the computed sleep delay. This feature can be used by:
    <ul> 
        <li><complink name="Gaussian Random Timer"/></li>
        <li><complink name="Poisson Random Timer"/></li>
        <li><complink name="Uniform Random Timer"/></li>
    </ul> 
    </note>
    <note>
    Note that timers are processed <b>before</b> each sampler in the scope in which they are found;
    if there are several timers in the same scope, <b>all</b> the timers will be processed <b>before
    each</b> sampler.
    <br></br>
    Timers are only processed in conjunction with a sampler.
    A timer which is not in the same scope as a sampler will not be processed at all.
    <br></br>
    To apply a timer to a single sampler, add the timer as a child element of the sampler.
    The timer will be applied before the sampler is executed.
    To apply a timer after a sampler, either add it to the next sampler, or add it as the
    child of a <complink name="Test Action"/> Sampler.

<description><p>This timer introduces variable pauses, calculated to keep the total throughput (in terms of samples per minute) as close as possible to a give figure.

<p>
N.B. although the Timer is called the Constant Throughput timer, the throughput value does not need to be constant.
It can be defined in terms of a variable or function call, and the value can be changed during a test.
The value can be changed in various ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>using a counter variable</li>
<li>using a <code>__jexl3</code>, <code>__groovy</code> function to provide a changing value</li>
<li>using the remote BeanShell server to change a JMeter property</li>
</ul>

<note>
Note that the throughput value should not be changed too often during a test

<component name="Precise Throughput Timer" index="&sect-num;.6.5" width="523" height="318" screenshot="timers/precise_throughput_timer.png">
<description><p>This timer introduces variable pauses, calculated to keep the total throughput (e.g. in terms of samples per minute) as close as possible to a give figure. Of course the throughput will be lower if the server is not capable of handling it, or if other timers, or if there's not enough threads, or time-consuming test elements prevent it.</p>
<p>Although the Timer is called Precise Throughput Timer, it does not aim to produce precisely the same number of samples over one-second intervals during the test.</p>
<p>The timer works best for rates under 36000 requests/hour, however your mileage might vary (see monitoring section below if your goals are
    vastly different).</p>

<h4>Best location of a Precise Throughput Timer in a Test Plan</h4>
<p>As you might know, the timers are inherited by all the siblings and their child elements. That is why one of the best places for
    <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> is under the first element in a test loop. For instance, you might add a dummy sampler at the beginning,
    and place the timer under that dummy sampler</p>

<h4>Produced schedule</h4>
<p><code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> models <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process">Poisson arrivals</a> schedule. That schedule often happens in a real-life, so it makes sense to use that for load testing.
    For instance, it naturally might generate samples that are close together thus it might reveal concurrency issues. Even if you manage to generate Poisson arrivals
    with <complink name="Poisson Random Timer"/>, it would be susceptible to the issues listed below. For instance, true Poisson arrivals might have indefinitely long
    pause, and that is not practical for load testing. For instance, "regular" Poisson arrivals with 1 per second rate might end up with 50 samples over 60 second long test.</p>
<p><complink name="Constant Throughput Timer"/> converges to the specified rate, however it tends to produce samples at even intervals.</p>

<h4>Ramp-up and startup spike</h4>
<p>You might used "ramp-up" or similar approaches to avoid a spike at the test start. For instance, if you configure <complink name="Thread Group" /> to have
    100 threads, and set <code>Ramp-up Period</code> to 0 (or to a small number), then all the threads would start at the same time, and it would produce an unwanted spike of the load. On top of that, if you set <code>Ramp-up Period</code> too high, it might result in "too few" threads being available at the very beginning to achieve
the required load.</p>
<p><code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> schedules executions in a random way, so it can be used to generate constant load, and it is recommended to set both
    <code>Ramp-up Period</code> and <code>Delay</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>

<h4>Multiple thread groups starting at the same time</h4>
<p>A variation of <code>Ramp-up</code> issue might appear when <complink name="Test Plan" /> includes multiple <complink name="Thead Group" />s. To mitigate that issue
    one typically adds "random" delay to each <complink name="Thead Group" /> so threads start at different times.</p>
<p><code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> avoids that issue since it schedules executions in a random way. You do not need to add extra random delays to mitigate startup spike</p>

<h4>Number of iterations per hour</h4>
<p>One of the basic requirements is to issue N samples per M minutes. Let it be 60 iterations per hour. Business customers would not understand if you report load test
    results with 57 executions "just because the random was random". In order to generate 60 iterations per hour, you need to configure as follows (other parameters
    could be left with their default values)</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Target throughput (samples)</code>: 60</li>
    <li><code>Throughput period (seconds)</code>: 3600</li>
    <li><code>Test duration (seconds)</code>: 3600</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two options set the throughput. Even though 60/3600, 30/1800, and 120/7200 represent exactly the same load level, pick the one that represents
    business requirements better. For instance, if the requirement is to test for "60 sample per hour", then set 60/3600. If the requirement is to test "1 sample per minute",
    then set 1/60.</p>
<p><code>Test duration (seconds)</code> is there so the timer ensures exact number of samples for a given test duration. <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> creates
    a schedule for the samples at the test startup. For instance, if you
    wish to perform 5 minutes test with 60 per hour throughput, you would set <code>Test duration (seconds)</code> to 300. This enables to configure throughput
    in a business-friendly way. Note: <code>Test duration (seconds)</code> does <b>not</b> limit test duration. It is just a hint for the timer.</p>

<h4>Number of threads and think times</h4>
<p>One of the common pitfalls is to adjust number of threads and think times in order to end up with the desired throughput. Even though it might work, that approach
    results in lots of time spent on the test runs. It might require to adjust threads and delays again when new application version arrives.</p>
<p><code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> enables to set throughput goal and go for it no matter how well application performs. In order to do that, <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code>
    creates a schedule at the test startup, then it uses that schedule to release threads. The main driver for the think times and number of threads should be business
    requirements, not the desire to match throughput somehow.</p>
<p>For instance, if you application is used by support engineers in a call center. Suppose there are 2 engineers in the call center, and the target throughput is 1 per minute.
    Suppose it takes 4 minutes for the engineer to read and review the web page. For that case you should set 2 threads in the group, use 4 minutes
    for think time delays, and specify 1 per minute in <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code>. Of course it would result in something around 2samples/4minutes=0.5 per minute
    and the result of such a test means "you need more support engineers in a call center" or "you need to reduce the time it takes an engineer to fulfill a task".</p>

<h4>Testing low rates and repeatable tests</h4>
<p>Testing at low rates (e.g. 60 per hour) requires to know the desired test profile. For instance, if you need to inject load at even intervals (e.g. 60 seconds in between)
    then you'd better use <complink name="Constant Throughput Timer"/>. However, if you need to have randomized schedule (e.g. to model real users that execute reports),
    then <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> is your friend.</p>
<p>When comparing outcomes of multiple load tests, it is useful to be able to repeat exactly the same test profile. For instance, if action X (e.g. "Profit Report")
    is invoked after 5 minutes of the test start, then it would be nice to replicate that pattern for subsequent test executions. Replicating the same load pattern
    simplifies analysis of the test results (e.g. CPU% chart).</p>
<p><code>Random seed (change from 0 to random)</code> enables to control the seed value that is used by <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code>. By default it is
    initialized with <code>0</code> and that means random seed is used for each test execution. If you need to have repeatable load pattern, then change
    <code>Random seed</code> so some random value. The general advice is to use non-zero seed, and "0 by default" is an implementation limit.</p>
<p>Note: when using multiple thread groups with same throughput rates and same non-zero seed it might result in unwanted firing the samples at the same time.</p>

<h4>Testing high rates and/or long test durations</h4>
<p>When the number of samples is high (e.g. it exceeds 10'000), schedule generation might take noticeable time (e.g. seconds) as <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> tries
    to produce the exact number of samples. There's memory consumption as well, however it should not matter much as every item in the schedule consumes 8 bytes.
    In order to reduce schedule generation overhead, <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> allows some slack when generating long schedules. It is controlled by
    <code>Accuracy of generated delays</code> properties. By default, inexact schedules are allowed when number of samples exceeds 10'000.</p>
<p>If you want to perform 2-week long test with 5'000 per hour rate, you do not need to create a schedule for that 2 weeks.
    You can set <code>Test duration (seconds)</code> property of the timer to 1 hour. The timer would create a schedule of 5'000 samples for an hour, and when the schedule is exhausted, the timer would generate
    a schedule for the next hour.</p>

<h4>Bursty load</h4>
<p>There might be a case when all the samples should come in pairs, triples, etc. Certain cases might be solved via <complink name="Synchronizing Timer"/>, however
    <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> has native way to issue requests in packs. This behavior is disabled by default, and it is controlled with "Batched departures"
    settings</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Number of threads in the batch (threads)</code>. Specifies the number of samples in a batch. Note the overall number of samples will still be in line with <code>Target Throughput</code></li>
    <li><code>Delay between threads in the batch (ms)</code>. For instance, if set to 42, and the batch size is 3, then threads will depart at x, x+42ms, x+84ms</li>
</ul>

<h4>Variable load rate</h4>
    <p>Even though property values (e.g. throughput) can be defined via expressions, it is recommended to keep the value more or less the same through the test, as it takes time to recompute the new schedule to adapt new values.</p>

<h4>Monitoring</h4>
<p>As next schedule is generated, <code>Precise Throughput Timer</code> logs a message to <code>jmeter.log</code>:
    <code>2018-01-04 17:34:03,635 INFO o.a.j.t.ConstantPoissonProcessGenerator: Generated 21 timings (... 20 required, rate 1.0, duration 20, exact lim 20000,
    i21) in 0 ms, restart was issued 3 times. First 15 events will be fired at: 1.1869653574244292 (+1.1869653574244292), 1.4691340403043207 (+0.2821686828798915),
    3.638151706179226 (+2.169017665874905), 3.836357090410566 (+0.19820538423134026), 4.709330071408575 (+0.8729729809980085), 5.61330076999953 (+0.903970698590955),
        ...</code>
This shows that schedule generation took 0ms, and it shows absolute timestamps in seconds. In the case above, the rate was set to be 1 per second, and the actual timestamps
    became 1.2 sec, 1.5 sec, 3.6 sec, 3.8 sec, 4.7 sec, and so on.</p>

<p>This modifier parses HTML response from the server and extracts
links and forms.  A URL test sample that passes through this modifier will be examined to
see if it &quot;matches&quot; any of the links or forms extracted
from the immediately previous response.  It would then replace the values in the URL
test sample with appropriate values from the matching link or form.  Perl-type regular
expressions are used to find matches.</p>

<example title="Spidering Example" anchor="spider_example">
<p>Consider a simple example: let's say you wanted JMeter to &quot;spider&quot; through your site,
hitting link after link parsed from the HTML returned from your server (this is not
actually the most useful thing to do, but it serves as a good example).  You would create
a <complink name="Simple Controller"/>, and add the &quot;HTML Link Parser&quot; to it.  Then, create an
HTTP Request, and set the domain to &quot;<code>.*</code>&quot;, and the path likewise. This will
cause your test sample to match with any link found on the returned pages.  If you wanted to
restrict the spidering to a particular domain, then change the domain value
to the one you want.  Then, only links to that domain will be followed.
</p>
</example>

<example title="Poll Example" anchor="poll_example">
<p>A more useful example: given a web polling application, you might have a page with
several poll options as radio buttons for the user to select.  Let's say the values
of the poll options are very dynamic - maybe user generated.  If you wanted JMeter to
test the poll, you could either create test samples with hardcoded values chosen, or you
could let the HTML Link Parser parse the form, and insert a random poll option into
your URL test sample.  To do this, follow the above example, except, when configuring
your Web Test controller's URL options, be sure to choose &quot;<code>POST</code>&quot; as the
method.  Put in hard-coded values for the <code>domain</code>, <code>path</code>, and any additional form parameters.
Then, for the actual radio button parameter, put in the name (let's say it's called &quot;<code>poll_choice</code>&quot;),
and then &quot;<code>.*</code>&quot; for the value of that parameter.  When the modifier examines
this URL test sample, it will find that it &quot;matches&quot; the poll form (and
it shouldn't match any other form, given that you've specified all the other aspects of
the URL test sample), and it will replace your form parameters with the matching
parameters from the form.  Since the regular expression &quot;<code>.*</code>&quot; will match with
anything, the modifier will probably have a list of radio buttons to choose from.  It
will choose at random, and replace the value in your URL test sample.  Each time through
the test, a new random value will be chosen.</p>

<figure width="1250" height="493" image="modification.png">Figure 18 - Online Poll Example</figure>

<note>One important thing to remember is that you must create a test sample immediately
prior that will return an HTML page with the links and forms that are relevant to
your dynamic test sample.</note>

<description><p>This modifier works similarly to the HTML Link Parser, except it has a specific purpose for which
it is easier to use than the HTML Link Parser, and more efficient.  For web applications that
use URL Re-writing to store session ids instead of cookies, this element can be attached at the
ThreadGroup level, much like the <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/>.  Simply give it the name
of the session id parameter, and it will find it on the page and add the argument to every
request of that ThreadGroup.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this modifier can be attached to select requests and it will modify only them.
Clever users will even determine that this modifier can be used to grab values that elude the
<complink name="HTML Link Parser"/>.</p>

<component name="Sample Timeout" index="&sect-num;.7.11" anchor="interrupt" width="316" height="138" screenshot="sample_timeout.png">
<description>
<p>This Pre-Processor schedules a timer task to interrupt a sample if it takes too long to complete.
The timeout is ignored if it is zero or negative.
For this to work, the sampler must implement Interruptible. 
The following samplers are known to do so:<br></br>
AJP, BeanShell, FTP, HTTP, Soap, AccessLog, MailReader, JMS Subscriber, TCPSampler, TestAction, JavaSampler
</p>
<p>
The test element is intended for use where individual timeouts such as Connection Timeout or Response Timeout are insufficient,
or where the Sampler does not support timeouts.
The timeout should be set sufficiently long so that it is not triggered in normal tests, but short enough that it interrupts samples
that are stuck.
</p>
<p>
[By default, JMeter uses a Callable to interrupt the sampler.
This executes in the same thread as the timer, so if the interrupt takes a long while, 
it may delay the processing of subsequent timeouts.
This is not expected to be a problem, but if necessary the property <code>InterruptTimer.useRunnable</code>
can be set to <code>true</code> to use a separate Runnable thread instead of the Callable.]

<section name="&sect-num;.8 Post-Processors" anchor="postprocessors">
    <description>
    <p>
        As the name suggests, Post-Processors are applied after samplers. Note that they are
        applied to <b>all</b> the samplers in the same scope, so to ensure that a post-processor
        is applied only to a particular sampler, add it as a child of the sampler.
    </p>
    <note>
    Note: Unless documented otherwise, Post-Processors are not applied to sub-samples (child samples) -
    only to the parent sample.
    In the case of JSR223 and BeanShell post-processors, the script can retrieve sub-samples using the method
    <code>prev.getSubResults()</code> which returns an array of SampleResults.
    The array will be empty if there are none.
    </note>
    <p>
    Post-Processors are run before Assertions, so they do not have access to any Assertion Results, nor will
    the sample status reflect the results of any Assertions. If you require access to Assertion Results, try
    using a Listener instead. Also note that the variable <code>JMeterThread.last_sample_ok</code> is set to "<code>true</code>" or "<code>false</code>"
    after all Assertions have been run.

        For example if there is a main sample and 3 sub-samples, each of which contains a single match for the regex,
        (i.e. 4 matches in total).
        For match number = <code>3</code>, Sub-samples only, the extractor will match the 3<sup>rd</sup> sub-sample.

        If the regular expression does not match, then the reference variable will be set to the default value.
        This is particularly useful for debugging tests. If no default is provided, then it is difficult to tell
        whether the regular expression did not match, or the RE element was not processed or maybe the wrong variable
        is being used.
        <p>
        However, if you have several test elements that set the same variable, 
        you may wish to leave the variable unchanged if the expression does not match.
        In this case, remove the default value once debugging is complete.
        </p> 
        </property>
        <property name="Use empty default value" required="No">
        If the checkbox is checked and <code>Default Value</code> is empty, then JMeter will set the variable to empty string instead of not setting it.
        Thus when you will for example use <code>${var}</code> (if <code>Reference Name</code> is var) in your Test Plan, if the extracted value is not found then 
        <code>${var}</code> will be equal to empty string instead of containing <code>${var}</code> which may be useful if extracted value is optional.
        </property>
</properties>
<p>
    If the match number is set to a non-negative number, and a match occurs, the variables are set as follows:
</p>

        <li><code>refName_g<em>n</em></code>, where <code>n</code>=<code>0</code>,<code>1</code>,<code>2</code> - the groups for the match</li>
        <li><code>refName_g</code> - the number of groups in the Regex (excluding <code>0</code>)</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    If no match occurs, then the <code>refName</code> variable is set to the default (unless this is absent). 
    Also, the following variables are removed:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>refName_g0</code></li>
        <li><code>refName_g1</code></li>
        <li><code>refName_g</code></li>
    </ul>
<p>
    If the match number is set to a negative number, then all the possible matches in the sampler data are processed.
    The variables are set as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>refName_matchNr</code> - the number of matches found; could be <code>0</code></li>
        <li><code>refName_<em>n</em></code>, where <code>n</code> = <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code> etc. - the strings as generated by the template</li>
        <li><code>refName_<em>n</em>_g<em>m</em></code>, where <code>m</code>=<code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> - the groups for match <code>n</code></li>
        <li><code>refName</code> - always set to the default value</li>
        <li><code>refName_g<em>n</em></code> - not set</li>

        Matching is applied to all qualifying samples in turn.
        For example if there is a main sample and 3 sub-samples, each of which contains a single match for the regex,
        (i.e. 4 matches in total).
        For match number = <code>3</code>, Sub-samples only, the extractor will match the 3<sup>rd</sup> sub-sample.
        For match number = <code>3</code>, Main sample and sub-samples, the extractor will match the 2<sup>nd</sup> sub-sample (1<sup>st</sup> match is main sample).
        For match number = <code>0</code> or negative, all qualifying samples will be processed.

        </property>
        <property name="Default Value" required="No, but recommended">
        If the expression does not match, then the reference variable will be set to the default value.
        This is particularly useful for debugging tests. If no default is provided, then it is difficult to tell
        whether the expression did not match, or the CSS/JQuery element was not processed or maybe the wrong variable
        is being used.
        <p>
        However, if you have several test elements that set the same variable, 
        you may wish to leave the variable unchanged if the expression does not match.
        In this case, remove the default value once debugging is complete.
        </p> 
        </property>
        <property name="Use empty default value" required="No">
        If the checkbox is checked and <code>Default Value</code> is empty, then JMeter will set the variable to empty string instead of not setting it.
        Thus when you will for example use <code>${var}</code> (if <code>Reference Name</code> is var) in your Test Plan, if the extracted value is not found then 
        <code>${var}</code> will be equal to empty string instead of containing <code>${var}</code> which may be useful if extracted value is optional.
        </property>
</properties>
<p>
    If the match number is set to a non-negative number, and a match occurs, the variables are set as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>refName</code> - the value of the template</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    If no match occurs, then the <code>refName</code> variable is set to the default (unless this is absent). 
</p>
<p>
    If the match number is set to a negative number, then all the possible matches in the sampler data are processed.
    The variables are set as follows:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>refName_matchNr</code> - the number of matches found; could be <code>0</code></li>
        <li><code>refName_n</code>, where <code>n</code> = <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, etc. - the strings as generated by the template</li>
        <li><code>refName</code> - always set to the default value</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Note that the <code>refName</code> variable is always set to the default value in this case.

   <p>XPath is query language targeted primarily for XSLT transformations. However it is useful as generic query language for structured data too. See 
       <a href="http://www.topxml.com/xsl/xpathref.asp">XPath Reference</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath specification</a> for more information. Here are few examples:
   </p>
  <dl> 
   <dt><code>/html/head/title</code></dt>
     <dd>extracts title element from HTML response</dd>
   <dt><code>/book/page[2]</code></dt>
     <dd>extracts 2<sup>nd</sup> page from a book</dd>
   <dt><code>/book/page</code></dt>
     <dd>extracts all pages from a book</dd>
     <dt><code>//form[@name='countryForm']//select[@name='country']/option[text()='Czech Republic'])/@value</code></dt>
    <dd>extracts value attribute of option element that match text '<code>Czech Republic</code>'
        inside of select element with name attribute  '<code>country</code>' inside of
        form with name attribute '<code>countryForm</code>'</dd>
 </dl>
 <note>When "<code>Use Tidy</code>" is checked on - resulting XML document may slightly differ from original HTML response:
     <ul>
         <li>All elements and attribute names are converted to lowercase</li>
         <li>Tidy attempts to correct improperly nested elements. For example - original (incorrect) <code>ul/font/li</code> becomes correct <code>ul/li/font</code></li>
     </ul>
     See <a href="http://jtidy.sf.net">Tidy homepage</a> for more information.
 </note>
 
 <note>
<b>NAMESPACES</b><br/>
As a work-round for namespace limitations of the Xalan XPath parser (implementation on which JMeter is based) you need to:
<ul>
<li>provide a Properties file (if for example your file is named namespaces.properties) which contains mappings for the namespace prefixes: 
<source>
prefix1=http\://foo.apache.org
prefix2=http\://toto.apache.org
&hellip;
</source></li>

<li>reference this file in <code>user.properties</code> file using the property:
    <source>xpath.namespace.config=namespaces.properties</source></li>
</ul>
</note>
<p></p>
Another option is to use the following code:
<source>//mynamespace:tagname</source>
by:
<source>//*[local-name()='tagname' and namespace-uri()='uri-for-namespace']</source>
where "<code>uri-for-namespace</code>" is the uri for the "<code>mynamespace</code>" namespace.(not applicable if Tidy is selected)

<component name="Test Plan" index="&sect-num;.9.1"  width="560" height="457" screenshot="testplan.png">
<description>
<p>
The Test Plan is where the overall settings for a test are specified.
</p>
<p>
Static variables can be defined for values that are repeated throughout a test, such as server names.
For example the variable <code>SERVER</code> could be defined as <code>www.example.com</code>, and the rest of the test plan
could refer to it as <code>${SERVER}</code>. This simplifies changing the name later.
</p>
<p>
If the same variable name is reused on one of more
<complink name="User Defined Variables"/> Configuration elements,
the value is set to the last definition in the test plan (reading from top to bottom).
Such variables should be used for items that may change between test runs, 
but which remain the same during a test run.
</p>
<p>
<note>Note that the Test Plan cannot refer to variables it defines.</note> 
If you need to construct other variables from the Test Plan variables, 
use a <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> test element.
</p>
<p>
Selecting Functional Testing instructs JMeter to save the  additional sample information
- Response Data and Sampler Data - to all result files.
This increases the resources needed to run a test, and may adversely impact JMeter performance.
If more data is required for a particular sampler only, then add a Listener to it, and configure the fields as required.
<note>The option does not affect CSV result files, which cannot currently store such information.</note>
</p>
<p>Also, an option exists here to instruct JMeter to run the <complink name="Thread Group"/> serially rather than in parallel.</p>
<p>Run tearDown Thread Groups after shutdown of main threads: 
if selected, the tearDown groups (if any) will be run after graceful shutdown of the main threads.
The tearDown threads won't be run if the test is forcibly stopped.
</p>
<p>
Test plan now provides an easy way to add classpath setting to a specific test plan. 
The feature is additive, meaning that you can add jar files or directories,
but removing an entry requires restarting JMeter.
<note>Note that this cannot be used to add JMeter GUI plugins, because they are processed earlier.</note>
However it can be useful for utility jars such as JDBC drivers. The jars are only added to
the search path for the JMeter loader, not for the system class loader.
</p>
<p>
JMeter properties also provides an entry for loading additional classpaths.
In <code>jmeter.properties</code>, edit "<code>user.classpath</code>" or "<code>plugin_dependency_paths</code>" to include additional libraries.
See <a href="get-started.html#classpath">JMeter's Classpath</a> and
<a href="get-started.html#configuring_jmeter">Configuring JMeter</a> for details.

<component name="Thread Group" index="&sect-num;.9.2"  width="911" height="390" screenshot="threadgroup.png">
<description>
<p>A Thread Group defines a pool of users that will execute a particular test case against your server.  In the Thread Group GUI, you can control the number of users simulated (number of threads), the ramp up time (how long it takes to start all the threads), the number of times to perform the test, and optionally, a start and stop time for the test.</p>
<p>
See also <complink name="tearDown Thread Group"/> and <complink name="setUp Thread Group"/>.
</p>
<p>
When using the scheduler, JMeter runs the thread group until either the number of loops is reached or the duration/end-time is reached - whichever occurs first.
Note that the condition is only checked between samples; when the end condition is reached, that thread will stop.
JMeter does not interrupt samplers which are waiting for a response, so the end time may be delayed arbitrarily.
</p>
</description>
<p>
Since JMeter 3.0, you can run a selection of Thread Group by selecting them and right clicking. A popup menu will appear:
<figure width="461" height="818" image="threadgroup-popup-menu.png">Popup menu to start a selection of Thread Groups</figure>

<br/>Notice you have 3 options to run the selection of Thread Groups:
<ul>
<li>Start : Start the selected thread groups only</li>
<li>Start no pauses : Start the selected thread groups only but without running the timers</li>
<li>Validate : Start the selected thread groups only using validation mode. Per default this runs the Thread Group in validation mode (see below)</li>
</ul> 

<b>Validation Mode:</b><br></br>
This mode enables rapid validation of a Thread Group by running it with 1 thread, 1 iteration, no timers and no <code>Startup delay</code> set to 0.
Behaviour can be modified with some properties by setting in user.properties:
<ul>
<li><code>testplan_validation.nb_threads_per_thread_group</code> : Number of threads to use to validate a Thread Group, by default 1</li>
<li><code>testplan_validation.ignore_timers</code> : Ignore timers when validating the thread group of plan, by default 1</li>
<li><code>testplan_validation.number_iterations</code> : Number of iterations to use to validate a Thread Group</li>
<li><code>testplan_validation.tpc_force_100_pct</code> : Wether to force Throughput Controller in percentage mode to run as if percentage was 100%. Defaults to false</li>

<component name="SSL Manager" index="&sect-num;.9.4" screenshot="">
<p>
  The SSL Manager is a way to select a client certificate so that you can test
  applications that use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
  It is only needed if you have not set up the appropriate System properties.

</p>
<note>If you want to test client certificate authentication, see <complink name="Keystore Configuration"/></note>
<b>Choosing a Client Certificate</b>
<p>
  You may either use a Java Key Store (JKS) format key store, or a Public Key
  Certificate Standard #12 (PKCS12) file for your client certificates.  There
  is a feature of the JSSE libraries that require you to have at least a six character
  password on your key (at least for the keytool utility that comes with your
  JDK).
</p>
<p>
  To select the client certificate, choose <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Options</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>SSL Manager</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menu bar.
  You will be presented with a file finder that looks for PKCS12 files by default.
  Your PKCS12 file must have the extension '<code>.p12</code>' for SSL Manager to recognize it
  as a PKCS12 file.  Any other file will be treated like an average JKS key store.
  If JSSE is correctly installed, you will be prompted for the password.  The text
  box does not hide the characters you type at this point -- so make sure no one is
  looking over your shoulder.  The current implementation assumes that the password
  for the keystore is also the password for the private key of the client you want
  to authenticate as.
</p>
<p>Or you can set the appropriate System properties - see the <code>system.properties</code> file.</p>
<p>
  The next time you run your test, the SSL Manager will examine your key store to
  see if it has at least one key available to it.  If there is only one key, SSL
  Manager will select it for you.  If there is more than one key, it currently selects the first key.
  There is currently no way to select other entries in the keystore, so the desired key must be the first.
</p>
<b>Things to Look Out For</b>
<p>
  You must have your Certificate Authority (CA) certificate installed properly
  if it is not signed by one of the five CA certificates that ships with your
  JDK.  One method to install it is to import your CA certificate into a JKS
  file, and name the JKS file "<code>jssecacerts</code>".  Place the file in your JRE's
  <code>lib/security</code> folder.  This file will be read before the "<code>cacerts</code>" file in
  the same directory.  Keep in mind that as long as the "<code>jssecacerts</code>" file
  exists, the certificates installed in "<code>cacerts</code>" will not be used.  This may
  cause problems for you.  If you don't mind importing your CA certificate into
  the "<code>cacerts</code>" file, then you can authenticate against all of the CA certificates
  installed.
</p>

<component name="HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder" was="HTTP Proxy Server" index="&sect-num;.9.5"  width="1052" height="694" screenshot="proxy_control.png">
<description><p>The HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder allows JMeter to intercept and record your actions while you browse your web application
with your normal browser.  JMeter will create test sample objects and store them
directly into your test plan as you go (so you can view samples interactively while you make them).<br/>
Ensure you read this <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/jmeter/TestRecording210">wiki page</a> to setup correctly JMeter.
</p>

<p>To use the recorder, <i>add</i> the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder element.
Right-click on the Test Plan element to get the Add menu:
(<menuchoice>
  <guimenuitem>Add</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>Non-Test Elements</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
).
</p>
<p>
The recorder is implemented as an HTTP(S) proxy server.
You need to set up your browser use the proxy for all HTTP and HTTPS requests.
<note>Do not use JMeter as the proxy for any other request types - FTP, etc. - as JMeter cannot handle them.</note>
</p>
<p>
Ideally use private browsing mode when recording the session.
This should ensure that the browser starts with no stored cookies, and prevents certain changes from being saved.
For example, Firefox does not allow certificate overrides to be saved permanently.
</p>
<h4>HTTPS recording and certificates</h4>
<p>
HTTPS connections use certificates to authenticate the connection between the browser and the web server.
When connecting via HTTPS, the server presents the certificate to the browser.
To authenticate the certificate, the browser checks that the server certificate is signed
by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is linked to one of its in-built root CAs.
<note>Browsers also check that the certificate is for the correct host or domain, and that it is valid and not expired.</note>
If any of the browser checks fail, it will prompt the user who can then decide whether to allow the connection to proceed.  
</p>
<p>
JMeter needs to use its own certificate to enable it to intercept the HTTPS connection from
the browser. Effectively JMeter has to pretend to be the target server.
</p>
<p>
JMeter will generate its own certificate(s).
These are generated with a validity period defined by the property <code>proxy.cert.validity</code>, default 7 days, and random passwords.
If JMeter detects that it is running under Java 8 or later, it will generate certificates for each target server as necessary (dynamic mode)
unless the following property is defined: <code>proxy.cert.dynamic_keys=false</code>.
When using dynamic mode, the certificate will be for the correct host name, and will be signed by a JMeter-generated CA certificate.
By default, this CA certificate won't be trusted by the browser, however it can be installed as a trusted certificate.
Once this is done, the generated server certificates will be accepted by the browser.
This has the advantage that even embedded HTTPS resources can be intercepted, and there is no need to override the browser checks for each new server.
<note>Browsers don't prompt for embedded resources. So with earlier versions, embedded resources would only be downloaded for servers that were already 'known' to the browser</note>
</p>
<p>Unless a keystore is provided (and you define the property <code>proxy.cert.alias</code>),
JMeter needs to use the keytool application to create the keystore entries. 
JMeter includes code to check that keytool is available by looking in various standard places.
If JMeter is unable to find the keytool application, it will report an error.
If necessary, the system property <code>keytool.directory</code> can be used to tell JMeter where to find keytool.
This should be defined in the file <code>system.properties</code>.
</p>
<p>
The JMeter certificates are generated (if necessary) when the <code>Start</code> button is pressed.
<note>Certificate generation can take some while, during which time the GUI will be unresponsive.</note>
The cursor is changed to an hour-glass whilst this is happening.
When certificate generation is complete, the GUI will display a pop-up dialogue containing the details of the certificate for the root CA.
This certificate needs to be installed by the browser in order for it to accept the host certificates generated by JMeter; see <a href="#install_cert">below</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, you can force JMeter to regenerate the keystore (and the exported certificates - <code>ApacheJMeterTemporaryRootCA[.usr|.crt]</code>) by deleting the keystore file <code>proxyserver.jks</code> from the JMeter directory.
</p>
<p>
This certificate is not one of the certificates that browsers normally trust, and will not be for the
correct host.<br/>
As a consequence: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser should display a dialogue asking if you want to accept the certificate or not. For example:
<source>
1) The server's name "<code>www.example.com</code>" does not match the certificate's name
   "<code>JMeter Proxy (DO NOT TRUST)</code>". Somebody may be trying to eavesdrop on you.
2) The certificate for "<code>JMeter Proxy (DO NOT TRUST)</code>" is signed by the unknown Certificate Authority
   "<code>JMeter Proxy (DO NOT TRUST)</code>". It is not possible to verify that this is a valid certificate.
</source>
You will need to accept the certificate in order to allow the JMeter Proxy to intercept the SSL traffic in order to
record it.
However, do not accept this certificate permanently; it should only be accepted temporarily.
Browsers only prompt this dialogue for the certificate of the main URL, not for the resources loaded in the page, such as images, CSS or JavaScript files hosted on a secured external CDN. 
If you have such resources (gmail has for example), you'll have to first browse manually to these other domains in order to accept JMeter's certificate for them. 
Check in <code>jmeter.log</code> for secure domains that you need to register certificate for.
</li>
<li>If the browser has already registered a validated certificate for this domain, the browser will detect JMeter as a security breach and will refuse to load the page. If so, you have to remove the trusted certificate from your browser's keystore.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Versions of JMeter from 2.10 onwards still support this method, and will continue to do so if you define the following property:
<code>proxy.cert.alias</code>
The following properties can be used to change the certificate that is used:
</p>
<ul>

<h4>Installing the JMeter CA certificate for HTTPS recording</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, when run under Java 8, JMeter can generate certificates for each server.
For this to work smoothly, the root CA signing certificate used by JMeter needs to be trusted by the browser.
The first time that the recorder is started, it will generate the certificates if necessary. 
The root CA certificate is exported into a file with the name <code>ApacheJMeterTemporaryRootCA</code> in the current launch directory.
When the certificates have been set up, JMeter will show a dialog with the current certificate details.
At this point, the certificate can be imported into the browser, as per the instructions below.
</p>
<p>
Note that once the root CA certificate has been installed as a trusted CA, the browser will trust any certificates signed by it.
Until such time as the certificate expires or the certificate is removed from the browser, it will not warn the user that the certificate is being relied upon.
So anyone that can get hold of the keystore and password can use the certificate to generate certificates which will be accepted
by any browsers that trust the JMeter root CA certificate.
For this reason, the password for the keystore and private keys are randomly generated and a short validity period used.
The passwords are stored in the local preferences area.
Please ensure that only trusted users have access to the host with the keystore.

        <br/>
        For example, <code>*.example.com,*.subdomain.example.com</code>
        <br/>
        Note that wildcard domains only apply to one level,
        i.e. <code>abc.subdomain.example.com</code> matches <code>*.subdomain.example.com</code> but not <code>*.example.com</code>
        </property>
        <property name="Target Controller" required="Yes">The controller where the proxy will store the generated samples. By default, it will look for a Recording Controller and store them there wherever it is.</property>
        <property name="Grouping" required="Yes">Whether to group samplers for requests from a single "click" (requests received without significant time separation), and how to represent that grouping in the recording:
           <ul>
             <li><code>Do not group samplers</code> - store all recorded samplers sequentially, without any grouping.</li>
             <li><code>Add separators between groups</code> - add a controller named "<code>--------------</code>" to create a visual separation between the groups. Otherwise the samplers are all stored sequentially.</li>
             <li><code>Put each group in a new controller</code> - create a new <complink name="Simple Controller"/> for each group, and store all samplers for that group in it.</li>
             <li><code>Store 1<sup>st</sup> sampler of each group only</code> - only the first request in each group will be recorded. The "<code>Follow Redirects</code>" and "<code>Retrieve All Embedded Resources &hellip;</code>" flags will be turned on in those samplers.</li>

           </ul>
           The property <code>proxy.pause</code> determines the minimum gap that JMeter needs between requests
           to treat them as separate "clicks". The default is <code>5000</code> (milliseconds) i.e. 5 seconds.
           If you are using grouping, please ensure that you leave the required gap between clicks.
        </property>
        <property name="Capture HTTP Headers" required="Yes">Should headers be added to the plan?
        If specified, a Header Manager will be added to each HTTP Sampler.
        The Proxy server always removes Cookie and Authorization headers from the generated Header Managers.
        By default it also removes <code>If-Modified-Since</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> headers.
        These are used to determine if the browser cache items are up to date;
        when recording one normally wants to download all the content.
        To change which additional headers are removed, define the JMeter property <code>proxy.headers.remove</code>
        as a comma-separated list of headers.

        left empty, then everything is recorded (which can result in dozens of samples recorded for each page, as images, stylesheets,
        etc. are recorded).  <note>If there is at least one entry in the <code>Include</code> field, then only requests that match one or more <code>Include</code> patterns are
        recorded</note>.</property>
        <property name="Patterns to Exclude" required="No">Regular expressions that are matched against the URL that is sampled.

</properties>

<h4>Recording and redirects</h4>
<p>
During recording, the browser will follow a redirect response and generate an additional request.
The Proxy will record both the original request and the redirected request
(subject to whatever exclusions are configured).
The generated samples have "<code>Follow Redirects</code>" selected by default, because that is generally better.
<note>Redirects may depend on the original request, so repeating the originally recorded sample may not always work.</note>
</p>
<p>
Now if JMeter is set to follow the redirect during replay, it will issue the original request, 
and then replay the redirect request that was recorded.
To avoid this duplicate replay, JMeter tries to detect when a sample is the result of a previous
redirect. If the current response is a redirect, JMeter will save the redirect URL.
When the next request is received, it is compared with the saved redirect URL and if there is a match,
JMeter will disable the generated sample. It also adds comments to the redirect chain.
This assumes that all the requests in a redirect chain will follow each other without any intervening requests.
To disable the redirect detection, set the property <code>proxy.redirect.disabling=false</code>
</p>

<h4>Includes and Excludes</h4>
<p>The <b>include and exclude patterns</b> are treated as regular expressions (using Jakarta ORO).
They will be matched against the host name, port (actual or implied), path and query (if any) of each browser request.
If the URL you are browsing is <br></br> 
"<code>http://localhost/jmeter/index.html?username=xxxx</code>",<br></br> 
then the regular expression will be tested against the string:<br></br> 
"<code>localhost:80/jmeter/index.html?username=xxxx</code>".<br></br>   
Thus, if you want to include all <code>.html</code> files, your regular expression might look like: <br></br> 
"<code>.*\.html(\?.*)?</code>" - or "<code>.*\.html</code> 
if you know that there is no query string or you only want html pages without query strings.
</p>
<p>
If there are any include patterns, then the URL <b>must match at least one</b> of the patterns
, otherwise it will not be recorded.
If there are any exclude patterns, then the URL <b>must not match any</b> of the patterns
, otherwise it will not be recorded.
Using a combination of includes and excludes,
you should be able to record what you are interested in and skip what you are not.
</p>

<note>
N.B. the string that is matched by the regular expression must be the same as the <b>whole</b> host+path string.<br></br>Thus "<code>\.html</code>" will <b>not</b> match <code>localhost:80/index.html</code>
</note>

<h4>Capturing binary POST data</h4>
<p>
JMeter is able to capture binary POST data.
To configure which <code>content-types</code> are treated as binary, update the JMeter property <code>proxy.binary.types</code>.
The default settings are as follows:
</p>
<source>
# These content-types will be handled by saving the request in a file:
proxy.binary.types=application/x-amf,application/x-java-serialized-object
# The files will be saved in this directory:
proxy.binary.directory=user.dir
# The files will be created with this file filesuffix:
proxy.binary.filesuffix=.binary
</source>

<h4>Adding timers</h4>
<p>It is also possible to have the proxy add timers to the recorded script. To
do this, create a timer directly within the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder component.
The proxy will place a copy of this timer into each sample it records, or into
the first sample of each group if you're using grouping. This copy will then be
scanned for occurrences of variable <code>${T}</code> in its properties, and any such
occurrences will be replaced by the time gap from the previous sampler
recorded (in milliseconds).</p>

<p>When you are ready to begin, hit &quot;<code>start</code>&quot;.</p>
<note>You will need to edit the proxy settings of your browser to point at the
appropriate server and port, where the server is the machine JMeter is running on, and
the port # is from the Proxy Control Panel shown above.</note>

<h4>Where Do Samples Get Recorded?</h4>
<p>JMeter places the recorded samples in the Target Controller you choose. If you choose the default option
"<code>Use Recording Controller</code>", they will be stored in the first Recording Controller found in the test object tree (so be
sure to add a Recording Controller before you start recording).</p>

<p>
If the Proxy does not seem to record any samples, this could be because the browser is not actually using the proxy.
To check if this is the case, try stopping the proxy.
If the browser still downloads pages, then it was not sending requests via the proxy.
Double-check the browser options. 
If you are trying to record from a server running on the same host,
then check that the browser is not set to "<code>Bypass proxy server for local addresses</code>"
(this example is from IE7, but there will be similar options for other browsers).
If JMeter does not record browser URLs such as <code>http://localhost/</code> or <code>http://127.0.0.1/</code>,
try using the non-loopback hostname or IP address, e.g. <code>http://myhost/</code> or <code>http://192.168.0.2/</code>.
</p>

<h4>Handling of HTTP Request Defaults</h4>
<p>If the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder finds enabled <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/> directly within the
controller where samples are being stored, or directly within any of its parent controllers, the recorded samples
will have empty fields for the default values you specified. You may further control this behaviour by placing an
HTTP Request Defaults element directly within the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder, whose non-blank values will override
those in the other HTTP Request Defaults. See <a href="best-practices.html#proxy_server"> Best
Practices with the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder</a> for more info.</p>

<h4>User Defined Variable replacement</h4>
<p>Similarly, if the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder finds <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> (UDV) directly within the
controller where samples are being stored, or directly within any of its parent controllers, the recorded samples
will have any occurrences of the values of those variables replaced by the corresponding variable. Again, you can
place User Defined Variables directly within the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder to override the values to be replaced. See
<a href="best-practices.html#proxy_server"> Best Practices with the Test Script Recorder</a> for more info.</p>

<note>Please note that matching is case-sensitive.</note>

<p>Replacement by Variables: by default, the Proxy server looks for all occurrences of UDV values. 
If you define the variable <code>WEB</code> with the value <code>www</code>, for example,
the string <code>www</code> will be replaced by <code>${WEB}</code> wherever it is found.
To avoid this happening everywhere, set the "<code>Regex Matching</code>" check-box.
This tells the proxy server to treat values as Regexes (using the perl5 compatible regex matchers provided by ORO).</p>

<p>If "<code>Regex Matching</code>" is selected every variable will be compiled into a perl compatible regex enclosed in
<code>\b(</code> and <code>)\b</code>. That way each match will start and end at a word boundary.</p>

<note>Note that the boundary characters are not part of the matching group, e.g. <code>n.*</code> to match <code>name</code> out
of <code>You can call me 'name'</code>.</note>

<p>If you don't want your regex to be enclosed with those boundary matchers, you have to enclose your
regex within parens, e.g <code>('.*?')</code> to match <code>'name'</code> out of <code>You can call me 'name'</code>.</p>

<note>
The variables will be checked in random order. So ensure, that the potential matches don't overlap.
Overlapping matchers would be <code>.*</code> (which matches anything) and <code>www</code> (which
matches <code>www</code> only). Non-overlapping matchers would be <code>a+</code> (matches a sequence
of <code>a</code>'s) and <code>b+</code> (matches a sequence of <code>b</code>'s).
</note>

<p>If you want to match a whole string only, enclose it in <code>(^</code> and <code>$)</code>, e.g. <code>(^thus$)</code>.
The parens are necessary, since the normally added boundary characters will prevent <code>^</code> and
<code>$</code> to match.</p>

<p>If you want to match <code>/images</code> at the start of a string only, use the value <code>(^/images)</code>.
Jakarta ORO also supports zero-width look-ahead, so one can match <code>/images/&hellip;</code>
but retain the trailing <code>/</code> in the output by using <code>(^/images(?=/))</code>.</p>

<note>
Note that the current version of Jakarta ORO does not support look-behind - i.e. <code>(?&lt;=&hellip;)</code> or <code>(?&lt;!&hellip;)</code>.
</note>

<p>Look out for overlapping matchers. For example the value <code>.*</code> as a regex in a variable named
<code>regex</code> will partly match a previous replaced variable, which will result in something like
<code>${{regex}</code>, which is most probably not the desired result.</p>

<p>If there are any problems interpreting any variables as patterns, these are reported in <code>jmeter.log</code>,
so be sure to check this if UDVs are not working as expected.</p>

<p>When you are done recording your test samples, stop the proxy server (hit the &quot;<code>stop</code>&quot; button).  Remember to reset
your browser's proxy settings.  Now, you may want to sort and re-order the test script, add timers, listeners, a
cookie manager, etc.</p>

<h4>How can I record the server's responses too?</h4>
<p>Just place a <complink name="View Results Tree"/> listener as a child of the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder and the responses will be displayed. 
You can also add a <complink name="Save Responses to a file"/> Post-Processor which will save the responses to files.
</p>

<h4>Associating requests with responses</h4>
<p>
If you define the property <code>proxy.number.requests=true</code> 
JMeter will add a number to each sampler and each response.
Note that there may be more responses than samplers if excludes or includes have been used.
Responses that have been excluded will have labels enclosed in <code>[</code> and <code>],</code> for example <code>[23 /favicon.ico]</code> 
</p>
<h4>Cookie Manager</h4>
<p>
If the server you are testing against uses cookies, remember to add an <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/> to the test plan
when you have finished recording it.
During recording, the browser handles any cookies, but JMeter needs a Cookie Manager
to do the cookie handling during a test run.
The JMeter Proxy server passes on all cookies sent by the browser during recording, but does not save them to the test
plan because they are likely to change between runs.
</p>
<h4>Authorization Manager</h4>
<p>
The HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder grabs "<code>Authentication</code>" header, tries to compute the Auth Policy. If Authorization Manager was added to target
controller manually, HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder will find it and add authorization (matching ones will be removed). Otherwise
Authorization Manager will be added to target controller with authorization object.
You may have to fix automatically computed values after recording.

</p>
<h4>Uploading files</h4>
<p>
Some browsers (e.g. Firefox and Opera) don't include the full name of a file when uploading files.
This can cause the JMeter proxy server to fail.
One solution is to ensure that any files to be uploaded are in the JMeter working directory,
either by copying the files there or by starting JMeter in the directory containing the files.
</p>
<h4>Recording HTTP Based Non Textual Protocols not natively available in JMeter</h4>
<p>
You may have to record an HTTP protocol that is not handled by default by JMeter (Custom Binary Protocol, Adobe Flex, Microsoft Silverlight, &hellip; ).
Although JMeter does not provide a native proxy implementation to record these protocols, you have the ability to
record these protocols by implementing a custom <code>SamplerCreator</code>. This Sampler Creator will translate the binary format into a <code>HTTPSamplerBase</code> subclass
that can be added to the JMeter Test Case.

        <property name="Name" required="Yes">Descriptive name for this element that is shown in the tree.</property>

<note>
When using Test Fragment with <complink name="Module Controller"/>, ensure you disable the Test Fragment to avoid the execution of Test Fragment itself.
This is done by default since JMeter 2.13.

    A special type of ThreadGroup that can be utilized to perform Pre-Test Actions.  The behavior of these threads
    is exactly like a normal <complink name="Thread Group"/> element.  The difference is that these type of threads 
    execute before the test proceeds to the executing of regular Thread Groups.

    A special type of ThreadGroup that can be utilized to perform Post-Test Actions.  The behavior of these threads
    is exactly like a normal <complink name="Thread Group"/> element.  The difference is that these type of threads 
    execute after the test has finished executing its regular Thread Groups.

<note>
Note that by default it won't run if Test is gracefully shutdown, if you want to make it run in this case, 
ensure you check option "<code>Run tearDown Thread Groups after shutdown of main threads</code>" on Test Plan element.
If Test Plan is stopped, tearDown will not run even if option is checked.
