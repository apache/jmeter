<section name="&sect-num;. Hints and Tips" anchor="hints">
<p>
This section is a collection of various hints and tips that have been suggested by various questions on the JMeter User list.
If you don't find what you are looking for here, please check the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-jmeter">JMeter Wiki</a>.
Also, try search the JMeter User list; someone may well have already provided a solution.
</p>
<subsection name="&sect-num;.1 Passing variables between threads" anchor="variable_and_threads">
<p>
JMeter variables have thread scope. This is deliberate, so that threads can act indepently.
However sometimes there is a need to pass variables between different threads, in the same or different Thread Groups.
</p>
<p>
One way to do this is to use a property instead. 
Properties are shared between all JMeter threads, so if one thread <a href="functions.html#__setProperty">sets a property</a>,
another thread can <a href="functions.html#__P">read</a> the updated value.
</p>
<p>
If there is a lot of information that needs to be passed between threads, then consider using a file.
For example you could use the <a href="component_reference.html#Save_Responses_to_a_file">Save Responses to a file</a>
listener or perhaps a BeanShell PostProcessor in one thread, and read the file using the HTTP Sampler "file:" protocol,
and extract the information using a PostProcessor or BeanShell element.
</p>
<p>
If you can derive the data before starting the test, then it may well be better to store it in a file,
read it using CSV Dataset.

<subsection name="&sect-num;.2 Enabling Debug logging" anchor="debug_logging">
<p>
Most test elements include debug logging. If running a test plan from the GUI, 
select the test element and use the Help Menu to enable or disable logging.
The Help Menu also has an option to display the GUI and test element class names.
You can use these to determine the correct property setting to change the logging level.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="&sect-num;.3 Searching" anchor="searching">
<p>
It is sometimes hard to find in a Test Plan tree and elements using a variable or containing a certain URL or parameter.
A new feature is now available since 2.5.2, you can access it in Menu Search.
For now this feature only searches HTTP Samplers. If you find it useful log a Bugzilla enhancement request.
