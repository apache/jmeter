<section name="12. Introduction to listeners" anchor="intro">
<p>For those new to JMeter, a listener is a component that shows the results of the
samples. The results can be shown in a tree, tables, graphs or simply written to a log
file. To view the contents of a response from any given sampler, add either view
results tree or in table to a test plan. To view the response time graphically, add
graph results, spline results or distribution graph. For detailed explanation, of
each listener, please go to the components page.</p>

listener in the left panel. Click edit -> Save As Image. A file dialog will
appear. Enter the desired name and save the listener.
