<section name="&sect-num;. Remote Testing">

<p>In the event that your JMeter client machine is unable, performance-wise, to simulate 
enough users to stress your server, an option exists to control multiple, remote JMeter
engines from a single JMeter GUI client.  By running JMeter remotely, you can replicate 
a test across many low-end computers and thus simulate a larger load on the server.  One
instance of the JMeter GUI client can control any number of remote JMeter instances, and collect
all the data from them.  This offers the following features: 


<ul>
<li>Saving of test samples to a local machine </li>
<li>Managment of multiple JMeterEngines from a single machine </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
However, remote mode does use more resources than running the same number of non-GUI tests independently.
</p>
<p>Note that while you can indeed execute the JMeterEngine on your application 
server, you need to be mindful of the fact that this will be adding processing 
overhead on the application server and thus your testing results will be 
somewhat tainted.  The recommended approach is to have one or more machines on
the same Ethernet segment as your application server that you configure to run
the JMeter Engine.  This will minimize the impact of the network on the test 
results without impacting the performance of the application serer 
itself.
</p>

<p><b>Step 1: Start the servers </b></p>
<p>To run JMeter in remote node, start the JMeter server component on all machines you wish to run on by running the <b>JMETER_HOME/bin/jmeter-server</b> (unix) or <b>JMETER_HOME/bin/jmeter-server.bat</b> (windows) script.</p>

<p><b>Step 2: Add the server IP to your client's Properties File</b></p>
<p>Edit the properties file <i>on the controlling JMeter machine</i>.  In /bin/jmeter.properties, find the property named, "remote_hosts", and   
add the value of your running JMeter server's IP address.  Multiple such servers can be added, comma-delimited.</p>
<p>Note that you can also use the -J <a href="get-started.html#override">command line option</a> to specify the remote host(s) to use.
	E.g. jmeter -Jremote_hosts=host1,127.0.0.1,host2</p>

<p><b>Step 3a: Start the JMeter Client from a GUI client</b></p>
<p>Now you are ready to start the controlling JMeter client. For MS-Windows, start the client with the script "bin/jmeter.bat".  For UNIX, 
use the script "bin/jmeter".  You will notice that the Run menu contains two new sub-menus: "Remote Start" and "Remote Stop" 
(see figure 1). These menus contain the client that you set in the properties file.  Use the remote start and stop instead of the 
normal JMeter start and stop menu items.</p>
<figure image="remote/run-menu00.gif" width="232" height="156">Figure 1 - Run Menu</figure>

<p><b>Step 3b: Start the JMeter from a non-GUI Client</b></p>
<p>
As an alternative, you can start the remote server(s) from a non-GUI (command-line) client.
The command to do this is:
<pre>
jmeter -n -t script.jmx -r
or
jmeter -n -t script.jmx -R server1,server2...
</pre>
The first example will start whatever servers are defined in the JMeter property remote_hosts;
the second example will define remote_hosts from the list of servers and then run the remote servers.
<br/>
The command-line client will exit when all the remote servers have stopped.
<note>
There is currently no way to stop the remote servers gracefully from the command-line.
</note>

<subsection name="&sect-num;.1 Doing it Manually" anchor="detail_instructions">
<p>In some cases, the jmeter-server script may not work for you (if you are using an OS platform not anticipated by the JMeter developers).  Here is how to start the JMeter servers (step 1 above) with a more manual process:</p>
<p><b>Step 1a: Start the RMI Registry</b></p>
<p>JMeter uses Remote Method Invocation (RMI) as the remote communication mechanism.  Therefore, you need
to run the RMI Registry application (which is named, "rmiregistry") that comes with the JDK and is located in the "bin" 
directory.  Before running rmiregistry, make sure that the following jars are in your system claspath:
<ul>
	<li>JMETER_HOME/lib/ext/ApacheJMeter_core.jar</li>
	<li>JMETER_HOME/lib/jorphan.jar</li>
	<li>JMETER_HOME/lib/logkit-1.2.jar</li>
</ul>
The 
rmiregistry application needs access to certain JMeter classes.  Run rmiregistry with no parameters.  By default the 
application listens to port 1099.</p>

<p><b>Step 1b: Start the JMeter Server</b></p>
<p>Once the RMI Registry application is running, start the JMeter Server.  
Use the "-s" option with the jmeter startup script ("jmeter -s").</p>

<p>Steps 2 and 3 remain the same.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="&sect-num;.2 Tips" anchor="tips">
<p>If you're running Suse Linux, these tips may help. The default installation may enable the firewall. In that case, remote testing will not work properly. The following tips were contributed by Sergey Ten.</p>
<p>If you see connections refused, turn on debugging by passing the following options.</p>
     rmiregistry -J-Dsun.rmi.log.debug=true
     -J-Dsun.rmi.server.exceptionTrace=true
     -J-Dsun.rmi.loader.logLevel=verbose
     -J-Dsun.rmi.dgc.logLevel=verbose
     -J-Dsun.rmi.transport.logLevel=verbose
     -J-Dsun.rmi.transport.tcp.logLevel=verbose
<p>The solution to the problem is to remove the loopbacks 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.2 from etc/hosts. What happens is jmeter-server can't connect to rmiregistry if 127.0.0.2 loopback is not available. Use the following settings to fix the problem.</p>
<p> Replace</p>
<ul>
    <li> `dirname $0`/jmeter  -s "$@"</li>
</ul>
<p> With</p>
<ul>
    <li> HOST="-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=[computer_name][computer_domain]</li>
    <li> -Djava.security.policy=`dirname $0`/[policy_file]"</li>
    <li> `dirname $0`/jmeter $HOST -s "$@"</li>
</ul>
<p>Also create a policy file and add [computer_name][computer_domain] line to /etc/hosts.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="&sect-num;.3 Using a different port" anchor="portchange">
<p>By default, JMeter uses the standard RMI port 1099. It is possible to change this. For this to work successfully, all the following need to agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the server, start rmiregistry using the new port number</li>
<li>On the server, start JMeter with the property server_port defined</li>
<li>On the client, update the remote_hosts property to include the new remote host:port settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Jmeter 2.1.1, the jmeter-server scripts provide support for changing the port.
For example, assume you want to use port 1664 (perhaps 1099 is already used).</p>
<pre>
On Windows (in a DOS box)
C:\JMETER> SET SERVER_PORT=1664
C:\JMETER> JMETER-SERVER [other options]

On Unix:
$ SERVER_PORT=1664 jmeter-server [other options]
[N.B. use upper case for the environment variable]
</pre>
<p>
In both cases, the script starts rmiregistry on the specified port, 
and then starts JMeter in server mode, having defined the "server_port" property.
</p>
<p>
The chosen port will be logged in the server jmeter.log file (rmiregistry does not create a log file).
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="&sect-num;.4 Using sample batching" anchor="batchmode">
<p>
Listeners in the test plan send their results back to the client JMeter which writes the results to the specified files
By default, samples are sent back as they are generated. This can place a large load on the network and the JMeter client.
There are some JMeter properties that can be set to alter this behaviour.
</p>
<ul>
<li>mode - sample sending mode - default is Standard</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Standard - send samples as soon as they are generated</li>
    <li>Hold - hold samples in an array until the end of a run. This may use a lot of memory on the server.</li>
    <li>Batch - send saved samples when either the count or time exceeds a threshold</li>
    <li>Statistical - send a summary sample when either the count or time exceeds a threshold. 
    The samples are summarised by thread group name and sample label.
    The following fields are accumulated:
    <ul>
    <li>elapsed time</li>
    <li>latency</li>
    <li>bytes</li>
    <li>sample count</li>
    <li>error count</li>
    </ul>
    Other fields that vary between samples are lost. 
    </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>The following properties apply to the Batch and Statistical modes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>num_sample_threshold - number of samples in a batch (default 100)</li>
    <li>time_threshold - number of milliseconds to wait (default 60 seconds)</li>
    </ul>
</subsection>
