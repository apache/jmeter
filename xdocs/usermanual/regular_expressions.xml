<section name="&sect-num;. Regular Expressions" anchor="regex">
<subsection name="&sect-num;.1 Overview">
<p>
JMeter includes the pattern matching software <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/">Apache Jakarta ORO</a>
<br/>
There is some documentation for this on the Jakarta web-site, for example 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/org/apache/oro/text/regex/package-summary.html">
a summary of the pattern matching characters</a>
</p>
<p>
There is also documentation on an older incarnation of the product at 
<a href="http://www.savarese.org/oro/docs/OROMatcher/index.html">OROMatcher User's guide</a>, which might prove useful. 
</p>
<p>
The pattern matching is very similar to the pattern matching in Perl. 
A full installation of Perl will include plenty of documentation on regular expressions - look for perlrequick, perlretut, perlre, perlreref.
</p>
<p>
It is worth stressing the difference between "contains" and "matches", as used on the Response Assertion test element:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
"contains" means that the regular expression matched at least some part of the target, 
so 'alphabet' "contains" 'ph.b.' because the regular expression matches the substring 'phabe'.
</li>
<li>
"matches" means that the regular expression matched the whole target. 
So 'alphabet' is "matched" by 'al.*t'. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, it is equivalent to wrapping the regular expression in ^ and $, viz '^al.*t$'. 
</p>
<p>However, this is not always the case. 
For example, the regular expression 'alp|.lp.*' is "contained" in 'alphabet', but does not match 'alphabet'.
</p>
<p>Why? Because when the pattern matcher finds the sequence 'alp' in 'alphabet', it stops trying any other combinations - and 'alp' is not the same as 'alphabet', as it does not include 'habet'.
</p>
<p>
Note: unlike Perl, there is no need to (i.e. do not) enclose the regular expression in //. 
So how does one use the Perl modifiers ismx etc if there is no trailing /? 
The solution is to use Perl5 extended regular expressions, i.e. /abc/i becomes (?i)abc

<subsection name="&sect-num;.2 Examples">
<p>
Extract single string
<br/>
Suppose you want to match the following portion of a web-page: 
<br/>
name="file" value="readme.txt" and you want to extract readme.txt.
<br/>
A suitable reqular expression would be:
<br/>
name="file" value="(.+?)"
<p>
The special characters above are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>( and ) - these enclose the portion of the match string to be returned</li>
<li>. - match any character. + - one or more times. 
? - don't be greedy, i.e. stop when first match succeeds</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: without the ?, the .+ would continue past the first " until it found the last possible " - probably not what was intended.
</p>
<p>Extract multiple strings</p>

Suppose you want to match the following portion of a web-page: name="file.name" value="readme.txt" and you want to extract file.name and readme.txt.
<br/>
A suitable reqular expression would be:
<br/>
name="(.+?)" value="(.+?)"
<br/>
This would create 2 groups, which could be used in the JMeter Regular Expression Extractor template as $1$ and $2$.
<p>
The JMeter Regex Extractor saves the values of the groups in additional variables.
</p>
<p>
For example, assume:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference Name: MYREF</li>
<li>Regex: name="(.+?)" value="(.+?)"</li>
<li>Template: $1$$2$</li>
</ul>
<note>Do not enclose the regular expression in / /</note>
<p>
The following variables would be set:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MYREF: file.namereadme.txt</li>
<li>MYREF_g0: name="file.name" value="readme.txt"</li>
<li>MYREF_g1: file.name</li>
<li>MYREF_g2: readme.txt</li>
</ul>
These variables can be referred to later on in the JMeter test plan, as ${MYREF}, ${MYREF_g1} etc 
</p>

<subsection name="&sect-num;.3 Line mode">
<p>The pattern matching behave in various slightly different ways, 
depending on the setting of the multi-line and single-line modifiers.
</p>
<p>There are the four possible combinations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Default behavior. '.' matches any character except "\n". ^ matches only at the beginning of the string and $ matches only at the end or before a newline at the end. 
</li>
<li>
Single-line modifier (?s): Treat string as a single long line. '.' matches any character, even "\n". ^ matches only at the beginning of the string and $ matches only at the end or before a newline at the end. 
</li>
<li>

Multi-line modifier (?m): Treat string as a set of multiple lines. '.' matches any character except "\n". ^ and $ are able to match at the start or end of any line within the string. 
</li>
<li>

Both modifiers (?sm): Treat string as a single long line, but detect multiple lines. '.' matches any character, even "\n". ^ and $, however, are able to match at the start or end of any line within the string. 
</li>
</ul>
