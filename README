                            Version 1.0 beta 1


  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache JMeter is a 100% pure Java application designed to test
  and measure the performance of URL retrieval and it may be used
  as a highly portable server benchmark as well as multiclient
  load generator.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the Java Apache 
  Project web site (http://java.apache.org).

  Requirements
  ------------

  The following requirements exist for installing Apache JMeter:

   o  Java Interpreter:

      A fully compliant Java 1.1 Runtime Environment is required for 
      Apache JMeter to execute. Since Apache JMeter uses _only_ standard
      Java APIs (java.*), please, do not file in a bug report if your 
      JRE fails to execute Apache JMeter because a class implementation
      is missing, or not fully compliant.

      o Supported Java Runtime Evironments are:
         - JavaSoft JDK 1.1.x for Solaris/Win32
         - JavaSoft JDK 1.2betax for Solaris/Win32
         - Microsoft 1.1.x compatible JVM for Win32
         - [PENDING: what others?]

      o Currently unsupported platforms are:
         - [PENDING: do some tests here]

   o  Java JFC 1.1 and above (Swing components):

      These GUI extentions are required for proper functioning. Due to
      incompatibility in the package names, the precompiled version works
      only with Swing placed under the packaging com.sun.java.swing while
      other placing as for JDK 1.2beta3 and JDK 1.2beta4 are not supported
      until JavaSoft settles this down.
      
      If you have JDK 1.2 you may look in the source code and uncomment
      those import lines to meet your needs or simply put the JFC 1.1 
      swingall.jar file in your classpath.
      
   o  Java Compiler [OPTIONAL]:

      A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a 
      precompiled java binary archive. Note that a compiler is required
      if you plan to build plugin classes for Apache JMeter.

  Installation Instructions and Documentation

  The documentation available as of the date of this release is
  also included, in HTML format, in the docs/ directory, and it may
