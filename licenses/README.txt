This directory structure contains licenses for non-ASF software.

The bin/ directory contains license files for 3rd party jars bundled with the binary distribution

The src/ directory contains license files for 3rd party source; it also applies to the binary distribution

Note that the bin/ directory is included in the source distribution because it is needed in order to create the binary distribution
