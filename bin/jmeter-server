# If the client fails with:
# ERROR - jmeter.engine.ClientJMeterEngine: java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 127.0.0.1
# then it may be due to the server host returning 127.0.0.1 as its address 

# One way to fix this is to define RMI_HOST_DEF below
#RMI_HOST_DEF=-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
