#
# List of paths (separated by ;) to search for additional JMeter plugin classes,
# for example new GUI elements and samplers.
# A path item can either be a jar file or a directory.
# Any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included,
# jar files in sub directories are ignored.
# The given value is in addition to any jars found in the lib/ext directory.
# Do not use this for utility or plugin dependency jars.

# List of paths that JMeter will search for utility and plugin dependency classes.
# Use your platform path separator (java.io.File.separatorChar in Java) to separate multiple paths.
# A path item can either be a jar file or a directory.
# Any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included,
# jar files in sub directories are ignored.
# The given value is in addition to any jars found in the lib directory.
# All entries will be added to the class path of the system class loader
# and also to the path of the JMeter internal loader.
# Paths with spaces may cause problems for the JVM
#Example for windows (; separator)
#user.classpath=../classes;../lib;../app1/jar1.jar;../app2/jar2.jar
#Example for linux (:separator)
#user.classpath=../classes:../lib:../app1/jar1.jar:../app2/jar2.jar

# The given value is in addition to any jars found in the lib directory
# or given by the user.classpath property.
# All entries will be added to the path of the JMeter internal loader only.
# For plugin dependencies using plugin_dependency_paths should be preferred over
