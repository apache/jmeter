# For details of Oracle Java network properties, see for example:
# http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/properties.html
#
# Sample properties:
#
#java.net.preferIPv4Stack=false
#java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false
#networkaddress.cache.ttl=-1
#networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl=10
#
#
# SSL properties (moved from jmeter.properties)

# Location of the truststore (trusted certificates)
#javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/cacerts

# Location of the keystore
#javax.net.ssl.keyStore=.keystore
#
#The password to your keystore
#javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit

# SSL debugging:
# See http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Debug
#
# javax.net.debug=help - generates the list below:
#all            turn on all debugging
#ssl            turn on ssl debugging
#
#The following can be used with ssl:
#        record       enable per-record tracing
#        handshake    print each handshake message
#        keygen       print key generation data
#        session      print session activity
#        defaultctx   print default SSL initialization
#        sslctx       print SSLContext tracing
#        sessioncache print session cache tracing
#        keymanager   print key manager tracing
#        trustmanager print trust manager tracing
#
#        handshake debugging can be widened with:
#        data         hex dump of each handshake message
#        verbose      verbose handshake message printing
#
#        record debugging can be widened with:
#        plaintext    hex dump of record plaintext
#
# Examples:
#javax.net.debug=ssl
#javax.net.debug=sslctx,session,sessioncache
#
#
# Enable the following property to allow headers such as "Host" to be passed through.
