/**
 * Description:<br>
 * <br>
 * Filter interface is designed to make it easier to use Access Logs for JMeter
 * test plans. Normally, a person would have to clean a log file manually and
 * create the JMeter requests. The access log parse utility uses the filter to
 * include/exclude files by either file name or regular expression pattern.
 * <p>
 * It will also be used by HttpSamplers that use access logs. Using access logs
 * is intended as a way to simulate production traffic. For functional testing,
 * it is better to use the standard functional testing tools in JMeter. Using
 * access logs can also reduce the amount of memory needed to run large test
 * plans. <br>
