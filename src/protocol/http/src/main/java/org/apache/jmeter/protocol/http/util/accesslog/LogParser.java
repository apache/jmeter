 * Description:<br>

 * LogParser is the base interface for classes implementing concrete parse
 * logic. For an example of how to use the interface, look at the Tomcat access
 * log parser.
 * <p>
 * The original log parser was written in 2 hours to parse access logs. Since
 * then, the design and implementation has been rewritten from scratch several
 * times to make it more generic and extensible. The first version was hard
 * coded and written over the weekend.
