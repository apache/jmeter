/**
 * This interface defines the interactions between the JavaSampler and external
 * Java programs which can be executed by JMeter. Any Java class which wants to
 * be executed as a JMeter test must implement this interface (either directly
 * or indirectly through AbstractJavaSamplerClient).
 * <p>
 * JMeter will create one instance of a JavaSamplerClient implementation for
 * each user/thread in the test. Additional instances may be created for
 * internal use by JMeter (for example, to find out what parameters are
 * supported by the client).
 * <p>
 * When the test is started, setupTest() will be called on each thread's
 * JavaSamplerClient instance to initialize the client. Then runTest() will be
 * called for each iteration of the test. Finally, teardownTest() will be called
 * to allow the client to do any necessary clean-up.
 * <p>
 * The JMeter JavaSampler GUI allows a list of parameters to be defined for the
 * test. These are passed to the various test methods through the
 * {@link JavaSamplerContext}. A list of default parameters can be defined
 * through the getDefaultParameters() method. These parameters and any default
 * values associated with them will be shown in the GUI. Users can add other
 * parameters as well.
 * <p>
 * When possible, Java tests should extend {@link AbstractJavaSamplerClient
 * AbstractJavaSamplerClient} rather than implementing JavaSamplerClient
 * directly. This should protect your tests from future changes to the
 * interface. While it may be necessary to make changes to the JavaSamplerClient
 * interface from time to time (therefore requiring changes to any
 * implementations of this interface), we intend to make this abstract class
 * provide reasonable default implementations of any new methods so that
 * subclasses do not necessarily need to be updated for new versions.
 * Implementing JavaSamplerClient directly will continue to be supported for
 * cases where extending this class is not possible (for example, when the
 * client class is already a subclass of some other class).
 * <p>
 * See {@link org.apache.jmeter.protocol.java.test.SleepTest} for an example of
 * how to implement this interface.
