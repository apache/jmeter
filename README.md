## What Is It?

Apache JMeter can measure performance and load test static and dynamic web applications.

It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers,
network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

## Features

Complete portability and 100% Java.

Multi-threading allows concurrent sampling by many threads and
simultaneous sampling of different functions by separate thread groups.

### Protocols

Ability to load and performance test many applications/server/protocol types:

- Web - HTTP, HTTPS (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET,...)
- SOAP / REST Webservices
- FTP
- Database via JDBC
- LDAP
- Message-oriented Middleware (MOM) via JMS
- Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)
- Native commands or shell scripts
- TCP
- Java Objects

### IDE

Fully featured Test IDE that allows fast Test Plan **recording**
 (from Browsers or native applications), **building** and **debugging**.

### Command Line

[Command-line mode (Non GUI / headless mode)](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#non_gui)
to load test from any Java compatible OS (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, ...)

### Reporting

A complete and ready to present [dynamic HTML report](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html)

![Dashboard screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/jmeter/master/xdocs/images/screenshots/dashboard/response_time_percentiles_over_time.png)

[Live reporting](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/realtime-results.html)
into 3rd party databases like InfluxDB or Graphite

### Correlation

Easy correlation through ability to extract data from most popular response formats,
[HTML](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#CSS/JQuery_Extractor),
[JSON](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#JSON_Extractor),
[XML](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#XPath_Extractor) or
[any textual format](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Regular_Expression_Extractor)

### Highly Extensible Core

- Pluggable Samplers allow unlimited testing capabilities.
- **Scriptable Samplers** (JSR223-compatible languages like Groovy).
- Several load statistics can be chosen with **pluggable tiers**.
- Data analysis and **visualization plugins** allow great extensibility and personalization.
- Functions can be used to provide dynamic input to a test or provide data manipulation.
- Easy Continuous Integration via 3rd party Open Source libraries for Maven, Gradle and Jenkins.

## The Latest Version

Details of the latest version can be found on the
[JMeter Apache Project web site](https://jmeter.apache.org/)

## Requirements

The following requirements exist for running Apache JMeter:

- Java Interpreter:

  A fully compliant Java 17 Runtime Environment is required
  for Apache JMeter to execute. A JDK with `keytool` utility is better suited
  for Recording HTTPS websites.

- Optional jars:

  Some jars are not included with JMeter.
  If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory
  - JDBC - available from the database supplier
  - JMS - available from the JMS provider
  - [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) -
  only needed for SMIME Assertion

- Java Compiler (*OPTIONAL*):

  A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a
  precompiled Java binary archive.
  > **Note** that a compiler is required to build plugins for Apache JMeter.

## Installation Instructions

> **Note** that spaces in directory names can cause problems.

- Release builds

  Unpack the binary archive into a suitable directory structure.

## Running JMeter

1. Change to the `bin` directory
2. Run the `jmeter` (Un\*x) or `jmeter.bat` (Windows) file.

### Windows

For Windows, there are also some other scripts which you can drag-and-drop
a JMX file onto:

- `jmeter-n.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI test
- `jmeter-n-r.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI remote (client-server) test
- `jmeter-t.cmd` - loads the file ready to run it as a GUI test

## Documentation

The documentation available as of the date of this release is
also included, in HTML format, in the [printable_docs](printable_docs) directory,
and it may be browsed starting from the file called [index.html](printable_docs/index.html).

## Reporting a bug/enhancement

See [Issue Tracking](https://jmeter.apache.org/issues.html).

## Build instructions

### Release builds

Unpack the source archive into a suitable directory structure.
Most of the 3rd party library files can be extracted from the binary archive
by unpacking it into the same directory structure.

Any optional jars (see above) should be placed in `lib/opt` and/or `lib`.

Jars in `lib/opt` will be used for building JMeter and running the unit tests,
but won't be used at run-time.

_This is useful for testing what happens if the optional jars are not
downloaded by other JMeter users._

If you are behind a proxy, you can set a few build properties in
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` for Gradle to use the proxy:

```properties
systemProp.http.proxyHost=proxy.example.invalid
systemProp.http.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.http.proxyUser=your_user_name
systemProp.http.proxyPassword=your_password
systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy.example.invalid
systemProp.https.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_user_name
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_password
```

### Test builds

JMeter is built using Gradle, and it uses [Gradle's Toolchains for JVM projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html)
for provisioning JDKs. It means the code would search for the needed JDKs locally, or download them
if they are not found.

By default, the code would use JDK 17 for build purposes, however it would set the target release to 8,
so the resulting artifacts would be compatible with Java 8.

The following command builds and tests JMeter:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

If you want to use a custom JDK for building you can set `-PjdkBuildVersion=11`,
and you can select `-PjdkTestVersion=21` if you want to use a different JDK for testing.

You can list the available build parameters by executing

```sh
./gradlew parameters
```

If the system does not have a GUI display then:

```sh
./gradlew build -Djava.awt.headless=true
```

The output artifacts (jars, reports) are placed in the `build` folder.
For instance, binary artifacts can be found under `src/dist/build/distributions`.

The following command would compile the application and enable you to run `jmeter`
from the `bin` directory.

> **Note** that it completely refreshes `lib/` contents,
so it would remove custom plugins should you have them installed to `lib/`. However, it would keep `lib/ext/` plugins intact.

```sh
./gradlew createDist
```

Alternatively, you could get Gradle to start the GUI:

```sh
./gradlew runGui
```
